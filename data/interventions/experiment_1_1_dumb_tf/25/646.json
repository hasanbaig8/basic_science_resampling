      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the 2005 film \"King Kong\" was the lead actress's biggest box office role. First, I need to identify who the lead actress in that movie was. From what I remember, the 2005 King Kong starred Naomi Watts as the lead, playing the character Ann Darrow. \n\nNow, the question is about whether this role was her biggest box office success. To determine that, I should consider her other major roles around that time and their box office performance. Naomi Watts has been in several notable films. For example, she was in \"The Ring\" (2002), which was a horror movie that did well at the box office. Then there's \"21 Grams\" (2003), which was a critically acclaimed drama but maybe not as commercially successful. \n\nAnother film she was in around that time was \"I Am Legend\" (2007), but that's after the 2005 King Kong. However, \"I Am Legend\" had a higher budget and might have had a bigger box office. Wait, but the question is about the 2005 film being her biggest. Let me check some box office numbers. \n\n\"King Kong\" (2005) had a worldwide gross of around $1.9 billion, which is a huge number. But was that Naomi Watts' biggest role in terms of box office? Well, she was the lead, but the film's success might be more due to the director (Peter Jackson) and the franchise. However, the question is about her role's box office performance. \n\nBut wait, maybe other roles she had had higher box office. For example, \"The Ring\" (2002) had a worldwide gross of about $278 million, which is less than King Kong. \"21 Grams\" was more of a prestige film, not a big box office hit. \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) had a worldwide gross of around $700 million, but that's a different film. Wait, but she wasn't in \"The Da Vinci Code\"\u2014that was Tom Hanks. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up some actors. Let me confirm: Naomi Watts was in \"King Kong\" (2005), \"The Ring\" (2002), \"21 Grams\" (2003), \"I Am Legend\" (2007), \"The Departed\" (2006), which was directed by Martin Scorsese. \"The Departed\" had a worldwide gross of around $350 million, which is less than King Kong. \n\nSo, considering that \"King Kong\" had a much higher box office than her other roles around that time, maybe it was her biggest. However, I should also consider that \"King Kong\" was a massive blockbuster, but perhaps she had other roles with higher box office numbers. Wait, but \"King Kong\" is one of the highest-grossing films of all time, so even if she wasn't the sole reason, the film's success would make her role a big one. \n\nBut the question is whether \"King Kong\" was her biggest box office role. If \"King Kong\" was the highest-grossing film she was in, then yes. But maybe other films she was in had higher numbers. For example, \"The Da Vinci Code\" was a huge hit, but she wasn't in it. Wait, she was in \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006)? No, I think that was Tom Hanks. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check the box office numbers for her films. Let me think again. \"King Kong\" (2005) grossed around $1.9 billion. \"The Ring\" was $278 million. \"I Am Legend\" was $510 million. \"The Departed\" was $350 million. So \"King Kong\" was the highest among these. So if those are her major films around that time, then yes, \"King Kong\" was her biggest box office role. \n\nBut wait, what about \"The Ring\" (2002) and \"I Am Legend\" (2007)? \"I Am Legend\" had a higher gross than \"The Ring\" but less than \"King Kong\". So if \"King Kong\" was the highest, then the answer would be yes. However, I need to make sure there are no other films she was in that had higher box office. For example, maybe \"The Impossible\" (2012), but that's after 2005. \n\nTherefore, based on the data I have, \"King Kong\" (2005) was the highest-grossing film Naomi Watts was in, making it her biggest box office role. So the answer would be yes. But I should double-check if there's any other role that might have higher numbers. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the role's box office, not the film's. But the film's box office would be the same as the role's. So if the film was her biggest, then the role would be. \n\nWait, but sometimes a film might have a huge budget, but the box office might be lower. But \"King Kong\" was a huge success. So the answer would be yes. Therefore, the decision is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the 2005 King Kong film was the lead actress's biggest box office role. First, I need to identify who the lead actress in King Kong (2005) is. The main female lead is Naomi Watts, right? She played Ann Darrow.\n\nNow, I need to check if this was her biggest box office role. To do that, I should compare the box office performance of King Kong with her other major roles. Let me think about her other films. She was in \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), which was a critically acclaimed film but not a huge box office success. Then there's \"The Ring\" (2002), which was a horror film that did well, but I'm not sure about its box office numbers compared to King Kong. \n\nAnother significant role was in \"21 Grams\" (2003), which was a drama film. Then there's \"The Departed\" (2006), where she played a character named Colin Sullivan. Wait, but that's after King Kong. Also, \"The Impossible\" (2012) was a big hit, but that's later. \n\nLooking up box office figures, King Kong (2005) was a massive hit. It grossed over $1.05 billion worldwide, which is one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Naomi Watts' role in that film was her biggest role in terms of scale and box office success. \n\nBut wait, maybe she had other roles with higher box office? For example, \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) had Heath Ledger, but she wasn't in that. \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) had her as a character, but I think that film's box office was lower than King Kong. \n\nSo, considering her other films, it seems that King Kong was indeed her biggest box office role. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I should double-check to make sure there's no other film with higher grossing numbers. For instance, \"The Ring\" made around $225 million, which is way less than King Kong's $1.05 billion. \n\nSo, yes, King Kong was her biggest box office role.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

She played Ann Darrow.\n\nNow, the question is about whether this role was her biggest box office success. To determine that, I should look at Naomi Watts' other films and their box office performances. Let me recall her other major roles. She was in \"The Ring\" (2002), which was a big hit. Then there's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004), which was critically acclaimed but maybe not the highest grossing. \"I Am Legend\" (2007) came after King Kong. Also, she starred in \"The Impossible\" (2012), which was a commercial success.\n\nWait, \"The Ring\" had a box office of around $248 million worldwide. King Kong (2005) made about $1.03 billion worldwide, which is significantly higher. So even though \"The Ring\" was her first big hit, King Kong's box office numbers are much higher. However, I need to check if there are any other films where she was the lead that might have higher gross. For example, \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) had a box office of around $728 million, which is less than King Kong. \"The Fighter\" (2010) was a smaller film. \n\nWait, but \"The Ring\" was a horror film, and King Kong was a big blockbuster. So even though \"The Ring\" was her breakout role, King Kong's box office was higher. Therefore, it's possible that King Kong was her biggest box office role. However, I should also consider if there are any other films she was in that might have higher numbers. For instance, \"The Impossible\" made around $354 million, which is less than King Kong. \n\nSo, based on this, King Kong (2005) was indeed her highest-grossing film. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But wait, I should double-check the exact box office numbers. Let me confirm: King Kong (2005) had a worldwide gross of approximately $1.03 billion, while \"The Ring\" was around $248 million. So yes, King Kong was her biggest box office role. Therefore, the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

Naomi Watts' other films, while successful, didn't reach those figures.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking whether the 2005 King Kong film was the lead actress's biggest box office role. First, I need to identify who the lead actress in King Kong (2005) was. From what I remember, the main actress in that movie was Naomi Watts. She played Ann Darrow, the character that's central to the story.\n\nNow, the question is about whether this role was her biggest box office success. To determine that, I should check Naomi Watts' other major roles and their box office performance compared to King Kong. Let me think. Naomi Watts has been in several films. For example, she was in \"The Ring\" (2002), which was a horror movie that did pretty well at the box office. Then there's \"21 Grams\" (2003), which was a drama. She also starred in \"I Am Legend\" (2007), which was a big action movie. \n\nWait, but the 2005 King Kong was a massive film. It was a big budget movie directed by Peter Jackson, and it was a remake of the classic. The box office numbers for King Kong (2005) were extremely high. It made over a billion dollars worldwide, which is a huge figure. That's definitely a significant role for Naomi Watts. \n\nNow, I need to compare that to her other roles. For instance, \"The Ring\" had a box office of around $250 million worldwide, which is less than King Kong. \"I Am Legend\" made over $500 million, but that's a different movie. However, \"I Am Legend\" was released in 2007, after King Kong. But wait, the question is about the lead actress's biggest box office role. So if King Kong was her biggest, then the answer is yes. \n\nBut I should also consider other roles. For example, she was in \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), which was a critically acclaimed film but not a big box office hit. Then there's \"The Impossible\" (2012), which was a disaster film that did well, but again, I think King Kong's numbers are higher. \n\nAnother point to consider: sometimes, the box office success isn't just about the movie's earnings but also the role's impact. However, the question specifically asks about box office role, so it's about the movie's performance. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a film where she had a bigger role that made more money. For example, if she was in a movie that had a higher gross. Let me check some numbers. King Kong (2005) grossed about $1.03 billion worldwide. \"I Am Legend\" made about $524 million, which is less. \"The Ring\" was $250 million. \"21 Grams\" was around $50 million. So, King Kong is definitely her biggest box office role. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure that there's no other film where she was the lead and had a higher box office. For example, she was in \"The Departed\" (2006), but that's a crime drama directed by Martin Scorsese. However, \"The Departed\" made around $350 million, which is still less than King Kong. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer is true. The 2005 King Kong was Naomi Watts' biggest box office role.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

Then there's \"The Ring\" (2002), which was a horror film that did well. However, \"King Kong\" (2005) had a worldwide gross of over $2 billion, which is one of the highest for any film. \n\nBut wait, was \"King Kong\" her biggest? Let me check. Naomi Watts' other big roles include \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), which was a cult hit but not a blockbuster. \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) was a huge hit, but that's a different movie. Wait, \"The Da Vinci Code\" was a 2006 film, so after King Kong. However, \"The Da Vinci Code\" was a significant box office success, but the question is about the 2005 film. \n\nSo, if \"King Kong\" (2005) was her biggest, then the answer is yes. But I need to verify if there were any other films she was in that had higher box office earnings. For example, \"The Ring\" (2002) had a box office of around $250 million worldwide. \"King Kong\" was much higher. \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) was even higher, but that's a different year. So if the question is about the 2005 film, then \"King Kong\" was her biggest at that time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she had other roles in 2005 that were bigger.

It's possible that it was her biggest at the time, but I need to compare the box office numbers. Let me recall the box office figures. King Kong (2005) grossed over $2.2 billion worldwide, which is a huge number.

But I need to confirm if there's a film she starred in that had higher gross. \n\nWait, \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) had a huge box office, but she wasn't in that. She was in \"The Departed\" (2006), which was a big hit, but that's a crime drama. The Departed grossed around $353 million.

Let me verify the box office numbers. \"The Ring\" grossed around $250 million worldwide, while King Kong made about $2.2 billion. Wait, that's a huge difference. So if \"The Ring\" did better than King Kong, then King Kong wouldn't be her biggest. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, \"The Ring\" was released in 2002, and King Kong in 2005. The box office figures for King Kong are indeed much higher. But wait, maybe there's another film. Let me think. Naomi Watts also starred in \"21 Grams\" (2003), which had a smaller budget and lower box office. What about \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001)? That's more of an arthouse film, so not a big box office. \n\nAnother possibility: \"The Departed\" (2006), but she wasn't in that. Wait, maybe \"Eagle Eye\" (2008)? No, that's not her lead role. Wait, maybe \"The Impossible\" (2012), but that's after King Kong. So, comparing the box office numbers, King Kong was a massive hit, but was it her biggest? Wait, \"The Ring\" was a significant hit, but King Kong's box office is much higher. However, \"The Ring\" was a horror film with a lower budget, while King Kong is a big budget blockbuster. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the lead actress's biggest box office role. If King Kong was her lead role, and it's the highest-grossing film she's been in, then the answer would be yes. But if there's another film where she was the lead and it did better, then no. Let me check. \n\nLooking up Naomi Watts' filmography, King Kong (2005) is one of her highest-grossing films. However, she also starred in \"The Ring\" (2002), which had a lower budget but was a massive hit. However, \"The Ring\" was a horror film, and its box office was around $250 million, while King Kong made over $2 billion. So King Kong is her biggest. But wait, is there a film where she was the lead and made more? Let me check. \n\nWait, \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) had a very high box office, but she wasn't the lead in that. The lead was Tom Hanks. So that's not relevant. Another film: \"The Sea Inside\" (2004), which had a lower box office. \n\nTherefore, King Kong (2005) was her lead role and one of the highest-grossing films she's been in. But wait, maybe \"The Ring\" is considered her biggest box office role? Wait, no, because \"The Ring\" is a lower budget film. Let me check the exact box office figures. \n\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, \"The Ring\" made $250.7 million worldwide, while \"King Kong\" made $2.17 billion. So King Kong is way higher. Therefore, if Naomi Watts was the lead in King Kong, then it's her biggest box office role. But wait, was she the lead in \"The Ring\"? Yes, she played the main character.

Let me check another source. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. For example, if the question is about the lead actress in the film, which is Naomi Watts, and whether that role was her biggest in terms of box office. Since King Kong made over $2 billion, which is the highest for her, the answer would be yes. Therefore, the answer should be true. But I'm not entirely certain.

First, I need to identify who the lead actress in King Kong (2005) is. The main female lead is Naomi Watts. So the question is about her biggest box office role.\n\nNext, I should check Naomi Watts' other major roles and their box office performance. She's been in several big movies. For example, she starred in \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), which was a critical success but maybe not the biggest box office. Then there's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004), which was also a hit. However, \"King Kong\" (2005) was a massive blockbuster. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm if \"King Kong\" was her biggest. Let me think. \"King Kong\" had a huge budget and was a major release. It grossed over $2 billion worldwide, which is a record for a film at the time. However, was that her biggest? She also starred in \"The Ring\" (2002), which was a horror film that did well, but not as much as King Kong. \n\nAnother angle: maybe other films she was in had higher box office numbers. For instance, \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) was a huge hit, but she wasn't the lead there; that was Tom Hanks. Wait, no, she was in \"The Da Vinci Code\" as a supporting role. So maybe her lead roles include \"King Kong\" and \"Eternal Sunshine,\" but \"Eternal Sunshine\" had a smaller budget and lower gross. \n\nWait, \"Eternal Sunshine\" was a critical and cult hit, but box office-wise, it didn't reach the same level as King Kong. So \"King Kong\" was a massive hit, so it's likely her biggest box office role. However, I should check if there's any other film where she was the lead and had higher gross. \n\nAnother possibility is \"The Others\" (2001), which was a horror film that did well, but again, not as much as King Kong. So putting it all together, the answer would be yes, King Kong was her biggest. But wait, I need to make sure that \"King Kong\" was her lead role. In the 2005 version, she played Ann Darrow, the lead. So yes, she was the lead. Therefore, the answer is yes, that film was her biggest box office role.

Naomi Watts has been in several big films. For example, she starred in \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), which was a critical success but maybe not the biggest box office.

Wait, \"The Ring\" was a horror film, and it did well, but I think \"King Kong\" was a bigger box office success. \n\nHowever, I need to be careful. Maybe she had another role that was even bigger. Wait, \"The Ring\" was released in 2002, and \"King Kong\" in 2005. \"The Ring\" had a higher gross in the US? Or was it \"King Kong\" that was higher? Let me think. \"King Kong\" was a massive blockbuster, so it's likely that it was her biggest box office role. \n\nBut wait, \"The Departed\" was released in 2006, so it's after 2005.

To determine that, I need to check if King Kong was her highest-grossing film. I know that Naomi Watts has been in several films.

Then there's \"21 Grams\" (2003), which was more critically acclaimed but maybe not as commercially successful. \n\nThe 2005 King Kong was a big budget film directed by Peter Jackson. It's a remake of the 1933 classic. The film was a massive hit, earning over $2 billion worldwide. That's a huge number. So, if Naomi Watts was in that film, it's likely that it was one of her highest-grossing roles. \n\nBut I should check if there are other films where she had bigger box office numbers. For instance, she starred in \"The Departed\" (2006), which was a critical and commercial success. However, \"The Departed\" was a more recent film, but maybe it had a higher box office? Wait, but King Kong was released in 2005, and The Departed came out in 2006. Let me think about the box office figures. \n\nKing Kong (2005) had a worldwide gross of around $2.2 billion, which is extremely high. \"The Departed\" had a worldwide gross of about $350 million, which is much lower. So, King Kong would have been a bigger box office success for her. \n\nAnother film she was in is \"Eagle Eye\" (2008), but that's after 2005. So, considering her roles up to 2005, King Kong would be the biggest. Also, she was in \"The Ring\" which was a hit, but the box office numbers for that film are lower than King Kong's. \n\nTherefore, it's likely that King Kong was Naomi Watts's biggest box office role at the time.

However, that was after \"King Kong.\" So if we're talking about the lead actress's biggest box office role, \"King Kong\" might have been the biggest at the time, but maybe \"The Departed\" was bigger. However, the question is specifically about the 2005 film \"King Kong.\" \n\nWait, the user is asking if \"King Kong (2005 film)\" was the lead actress's biggest box office role. So, considering that \"King Kong\" was a massive hit, and perhaps her other roles didn't surpass that.

Also, \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006) had her as a lead, but that's also after 2005. So in terms of box office, \"King Kong\" might have been her biggest up to that point. \n\nBut wait, \"The Ring\" was released in 2002, which was before \"King Kong.\" So \"King Kong\" would have a higher box office than \"The Ring.\" Therefore, if \"King Kong\" was her lead role in 2005, and that film had a higher box office than her other leading roles, then the answer would be yes. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that \"King Kong\" was a leading role, but maybe she had other roles in bigger films. For example, \"The Departed\" was a big hit, but she was not the lead in that. The lead was Leonardo DiCaprio. So her role in \"The Departed\" was a supporting one. \n\nSo, as the lead in \"King Kong,\" which was a huge box office success, it's likely that this was her biggest box office role at the time.

She's had several notable roles. For example, she played Laura in \"The Ring\" (2002), which was a big hit. Then there's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004), which was critically acclaimed but maybe not the highest grossing. Another significant film is \"I Am Legend\" (2007), which had a decent box office. \n\nBut wait, the 2005 King Kong was a massive film. It was a big budget movie directed by Peter Jackson, and it was a huge commercial success. The film grossed over $2 billion worldwide, which is one of the highest-grossing films of all time. So if Naomi Watts was in that film, it's likely that her role in King Kong was one of her biggest in terms of box office. However, I need to confirm if it was her biggest. \n\nLooking at her filmography, \"The Ring\" (2002) had a box office of around $280 million, which is significant. \"King Kong\" (2005) grossed over $2 billion, which is way higher. So even though \"The Ring\" was a hit, King Kong's box office would be much larger. Therefore, it's possible that King Kong was her biggest box office role. \n\nBut wait, maybe there are other films where she was a lead actress with higher gross. For example, \"The Departed\" (2006) had a box office of around $350 million, which is lower than King Kong. \"The Impossible\" (2012) grossed around $200 million. So it seems that King Kong's box office was higher than her other lead roles. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be yes, King Kong (2005) was Naomi Watts' biggest box office role. However, I should double-check if there are any other films where she was a lead actress with higher gross. For instance, \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001) was a smaller film, and \"21 Grams\" (2003) was also a smaller film. So I think the conclusion is correct. Hence, the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

So maybe \"The Departed\" was her biggest box office role. But I need to check the box office numbers. \"King Kong\" had a worldwide gross of around $1.9 billion, which is huge. However, \"The Departed\" earned around $350 million domestically, but maybe more globally? Wait, actually, \"The Departed\" was a big hit, but perhaps not as big as \"King Kong.\" \n\nBut wait, \"King Kong\" is a massive blockbuster. However, Naomi Watts wasn't the lead in \"The Departed\"\u2014the lead was Leonardo DiCaprio. Wait, no, in \"The Departed,\" she played a supporting role. The main roles were DiCaprio and Matt Damon. So maybe her biggest box office role was \"King Kong\" because that's the one with the highest gross. But I need to verify if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"The Ring\" had a higher gross. Let me think. \"The Ring\" was a horror film that did well, but \"King Kong\" is a much bigger film. However, sometimes the box office numbers can be influenced by the film's budget and marketing. Also, \"King Kong\" was a remake, but the original was a classic. \n\nWait, another angle: maybe the lead actress in \"King Kong\" was not Naomi Watts. Wait, no, that's correct. She was the lead. So if \"King Kong\" was a huge box office success, then it's likely her biggest role. But I should check if there's another film where she was the lead and had higher gross. \n\nWait, \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001) was a critically acclaimed film but not a box office blockbuster. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004) was also a critical success but not the biggest. \"The Ring\" was a big hit, but maybe not as big as \"King Kong.\" \n\nSo, considering that \"King Kong\" had a massive worldwide box office, it's possible that it was her biggest. But I need to confirm if that's the case. However, I'm not entirely sure if \"King Kong\" was her biggest. Another possibility is \"The Departed,\" but she wasn't the lead. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"The Ring\" was her biggest. Let me check some numbers. \"The Ring\" grossed around $225 million worldwide, while \"King Kong\" was over $1.9 billion. That's a huge difference. So \"King Kong\" would be her biggest. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But wait, the user is asking if \"King Kong\" was the lead actress's biggest box office role. If Naomi Watts was the lead, and \"King Kong\" had the highest box office, then the answer is yes. \n\nBut I should make sure there isn't another film where she was the lead and had higher gross.

But \"The Departed\" was released after \"King Kong.\" \n\nAlso, \"The Impossible\" (2012) was a big hit, but that's later.

For example, \"The Ring\" was a horror film that did well, but maybe not as much as \"King Kong.\" \n\nWait, but perhaps \"King Kong\" was her biggest. However, I need to be careful here. Let me think again. The 2005 \"King Kong\" was a massive box office success. However, if there was another film where she was the lead and that film made more money, then the answer would be no. \n\nBut I'm not sure if there was another film where she was the lead that did better. For example, \"The Departed\" was a big hit, but she wasn't the lead there. She was in \"The Ring\" (2002) as the lead. The box office for \"The Ring\" was around $250 million worldwide. \"King Kong\" was way higher. \n\nWait, but \"The Departed\" had a higher box office than \"The Ring\" but Naomi Watts wasn't the lead in that. She was in \"The Departed\" but as a supporting role. So the lead role in \"The Departed\" was Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio. \n\nSo, if \"King Kong\" was her lead role, and it was a huge box office success, then maybe that's her biggest. But wait, \"The Ring\" was her lead role, but it didn't make as much as \"King Kong.\" So the answer would be yes, because \"King Kong\" was her biggest. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Let me check some data. Wait, the 2005 \"King Kong\" had a worldwide gross of about $1.9 billion, which is one of the highest-grossing films of all time. \"The Ring\" was around $250 million.

No, I'm pretty sure it was Naomi Watts. So the answer would be yes.

So the question is about whether this role was her biggest box office success.\n\nNext, I should check Naomi Watts' other major roles and their box office performance. She's had several notable films. For example, \"The Ring\" (2002) was a big hit, grossing over $240 million worldwide. Then there's \"I Am Legend\" (2007), which made around $450 million. \"The Impossible\" (2012) was also successful, earning about $260 million. \n\nComparing these to King Kong's box office. The 2005 King Kong had a worldwide gross of around $1.04 billion, which is extremely high. However, the question is about the lead actress's biggest role.

Wait, but King Kong's box office is actually higher. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the 2005 King Kong grossed about $1.04 billion worldwide. \"I Am Legend\" made about $450 million. Wait, that's way less.

So if King Kong's box office is the highest among her films, then the answer is yes. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes. But wait, I need to confirm that King Kong was indeed her biggest. Let me check again. \n\nYes, King Kong (2005) is her highest-grossing film. So the answer would be true. But wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. The question is about the lead actress's biggest box office role. So the role itself, not the film. But the film's box office would be tied to the role. So if the film was the biggest, then the role is the biggest. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes. So the JSON would be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}"
