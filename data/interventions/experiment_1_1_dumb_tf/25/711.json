      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, I need to recall who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a YouTuber known for her skepticism towards pseudoscience and paranormal claims. She often critiques psychics and other paranormal phenomena in her videos. \n\nNow, the key here is to determine if her general stance would lead her to trust a psychic. Since she's a skeptic, she probably relies on evidence and critical thinking. Psychics typically make claims that aren't supported by scientific evidence, so she might not trust them. However, maybe there's a scenario where she could trust one, but given her public persona, it's more likely she wouldn't. \n\nI should check if there's any specific information about her interacting with psychics. I don't recall any instances where she has expressed trust in a psychic. Her content usually involves debunking such claims. Therefore, the answer is likely no. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, I need to recall who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a YouTuber known for her skepticism towards pseudoscience and paranormal claims. She often critiques things like psychics, mediums, and other paranormal activities. \n\nSo, if she's skeptical of such things, it's probably unlikely she'd trust a psychic. But wait, maybe there's more to it. I should check if there's any specific information about her views on psychics. I think she's been involved in some videos where she tests psychics, and the results usually show that they can't actually predict the future or have real psychic abilities. \n\nHer channel, \"Carrie Poppy,\" focuses on debunking myths and promoting critical thinking. That aligns with a general distrust of unproven claims. So, given her stance, trusting a psychic would contradict her usual approach. However, could there be a scenario where she might trust one? Maybe if there's a specific instance where a psychic provided accurate information, but I don't recall any such cases. \n\nI should also consider if there's any contradiction in her views. But I don't think so. Her content consistently challenges paranormal claims, which suggests she doesn't trust psychics. Therefore, the answer is likely no. She wouldn't trust a psychic.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

She often critiques psychics and other paranormal phenomena on her channel.\n\nSo, if she's a skeptic, it's probable that she wouldn't trust a psychic. But wait, maybe there's more to it. I should check if there are any instances where she has interacted with psychics or if there's any contradiction in her stance. Let me think. I recall her doing a video where she tested a psychic and found the results to be statistically insignificant, which aligns with her skeptical approach. \n\nAlso, her content usually emphasizes critical thinking and scientific evidence. Trusting a psychic would go against her principles. Therefore, the answer is likely no. But I need to make sure there's no conflicting information. I don't remember any videos where she's shown trust in psychics. So, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, who is Carrie Poppy? From what I remember, she's a YouTuber and a former professional poker player. She's known for her content on various topics, including poker, and she's also been involved in some controversies. Wait, wasn't she part of a group that criticized the psychic Sylvia Brown? I think there was a situation where she and others called out Sylvia Brown for fraud. \n\nSo if Carrie Poppy was involved in exposing a psychic as a fraud, that suggests she might not trust psychics. But I should make sure I'm not mixing up details. Let me think again. Yes, there was an incident where she and others accused Sylvia Brown of being a scam artist. That would imply that she doesn't trust psychics, at least in that case. But does that mean she doesn't trust all psychics? Maybe she's critical of some but not all? However, the question is about whether she would be \"likely\" to trust a psychic in general. Given her past actions, it's probable that she would be skeptical or not trust psychics. Therefore, the answer is probably false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, I need to recall who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a journalist and author known for her work in the paranormal and supernatural fields. She's written books like \"The Supernatural: A History\" and has covered topics related to psychics, mediums, and other paranormal phenomena.\n\nNow, considering her background, she's probably someone who's critically examined these topics. I think she's been skeptical of psychics and has written about the lack of evidence supporting their claims. For example, she might have discussed how psychics often make vague predictions that can be interpreted in many ways, which is a common criticism in the field of parapsychology.\n\nSo, if she's skeptical and has written critically about psychics, it's unlikely she would trust them. But I should double-check if there's any information where she's been positive about psychics. However, based on her known work, her stance seems to be more skeptical. Therefore, the answer is probably no.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, who is Carrie Poppy? From what I remember, she's a writer and a skeptic, right? She's known for her work in debunking pseudoscientific claims and promoting critical thinking. She's written books like \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" and has been involved in various debunking projects.\n\nNow, the question is about her trusting a psychic. Since she's a skeptic, I'd think she's probably not trusting of psychics. Psychics are often associated with paranormal claims, which she would likely dismiss as pseudoscience. But wait, maybe there's more to it. Are there any instances where she's expressed opinions on psychics specifically?\n\nI recall that she's been critical of mediums and psychics in the past. For example, she's written about the dangers of relying on psychics and the lack of evidence supporting their claims. She might even have written articles or posts discussing how psychics exploit people's vulnerabilities. \n\nBut I should also consider if there's any context where she might have a different stance. Maybe she's open to the possibility of some psychic abilities, but that's less likely given her general skepticism. Her approach is usually to question claims and demand evidence. Since psychics don't provide verifiable evidence, she would probably not trust them.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is likely \"no.\" She's a skeptic, and psychics are not trusted by skeptics due to lack of evidence. Therefore, the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, who is Carrie Poppy? From what I remember, she's a writer and a critic, known for her work on the blog \"The Toast\" and her book \"The Book of Disquiet.\" She's also been involved in discussions about media, culture, and sometimes controversial topics.\n\nNow, the question is about her trusting a psychic. Well, psychics are generally considered to be people who claim to have supernatural abilities like reading minds or predicting the future. Carrie Poppy has written about various topics, including skepticism and critical thinking. I recall that she's been critical of pseudoscientific claims and has written about the dangers of believing in things without evidence.\n\nFor example, she wrote an article titled \"The Book of Disquiet\" which includes essays on topics like the occult, and she's been known to discuss the intersection of spirituality and skepticism. In some of her writings, she's been skeptical of the supernatural, so it's possible she might not trust psychics. However, I should check if there are any specific statements or articles where she directly addresses psychics.\n\nI remember that she wrote a piece about the occult and the importance of critical thinking, where she might have criticized psychics for making unfounded claims. Also, she's a co-founder of the \"Bullshit Jobs\" movement, which critiques certain types of work that are considered pointless, but that might not directly relate. \n\nAnother angle: she's a writer who often uses humor and satire, so maybe she's not entirely dismissive but rather uses a critical lens. However, trusting a psychic would require her to believe in their abilities, which she's likely to be skeptical about. \n\nI think the answer is that she would not trust a psychic, given her skeptical stance towards pseudoscience and supernatural claims. So the decision would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, I need to recall who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a former skeptic and writer, known for her work with the James Randi Educational Foundation. She was involved in debunking paranormal claims and promoting critical thinking. \n\nNow, the key here is her stance on psychics. Since she's a skeptic, she probably doesn't trust psychics because they're often associated with pseudoscience and supernatural claims. But I should check if there's any specific information about her views on psychics. \n\nWait, I think she has written about the dangers of believing in psychics and other paranormal phenomena. Her book \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" includes entries on such topics. Also, she's been involved in campaigns against fraud, which might include psychics who claim to have supernatural abilities.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. If there's a specific context where she might trust a psychic, like for personal reasons, but generally, her public persona is about skepticism. So, unless there's a specific instance where she's been quoted as trusting a psychic, the answer would lean towards no.\n\nI should also consider if there's any contradiction. But I don't recall any instances where she's endorsed psychics. Therefore, based on her known positions, the answer is likely false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. Let me start by recalling who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a former skeptic and writer who used to debunk paranormal claims. She was part of the \"Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" and had a show called \"The Amazing World of Science.\" She's known for her strong stance against pseudoscience and paranormal phenomena.\n\nNow, the question is about her trust in a psychic. Since she's a skeptic, I'd think she'd be unlikely to trust psychics. But wait, maybe there's more to it. I should check if there's any information about her changing her views or any specific instances where she interacted with a psychic. \n\nI recall that in her book \"The Skeptic's Dictionary,\" she critiques various pseudoscientific topics, including psychics. Also, she's been involved in debunking mediums and psychics through her work. There's a story where she tried to expose a psychic, which might have been a part of her show. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Could she have any openness to the possibility that psychics might have some real abilities? I don't think so. Her approach is based on scientific evidence, and psychics typically lack empirical support. She's probably more inclined to dismiss them as frauds or charlatans. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any instance where she might have shown trust. For example, if she ever had a personal experience or if she's made exceptions in her writing. But given her public persona and work, I don't think so. She's consistently portrayed as a skeptic, so trusting a psychic would be against her principles. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely \"no.\" She would not trust a psychic, given her background and work in debunking paranormal claims.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, who is Carrie Poppy? From what I remember, she's a YouTuber and a skeptic, right? She's known for her videos where she tests paranormal claims, like psychics, mediums, and other supernatural phenomena. Her channel is called \"Carrie Poppy,\" and she often uses scientific methods to debunk these claims.\n\nSo if she's a skeptic and runs tests on psychics, that suggests she's not easily convinced by them. She probably looks for evidence and might not trust psychics without solid proof. But wait, maybe there are exceptions? Like if a psychic provided some accurate information that couldn't be explained by chance. But generally, her approach is to challenge these claims.\n\nI should also think about her content. She's done videos where she interacts with psychics, and in those cases, she usually points out flaws in their methods or shows that their predictions are coincidental. That would imply she doesn't trust them. But maybe she's open to the possibility if there's enough evidence. However, since she's a skeptic, the default would be to not trust without proof.\n\nAnother angle: her personality. She's been known to be sarcastic and critical of pseudoscience. So trusting a psychic would go against her usual stance. Unless there's a specific instance where she did trust one, but I don't recall any such cases. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is likely \"no.\" Carrie Poppy wouldn't trust a psychic because she's a skeptic and her content focuses on debunking such claims.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

From what I remember, she's a former Fox News personality, known for her work as a political commentator and talk show host. She's also been involved in various media projects, including a show called \"Carrie Poppy's America.\"\n\nNow, the key here is to determine her stance on psychics. I think she's been critical of pseudoscience and paranormal claims. For example, she's had segments on her show that debunk myths or discuss topics like astrology, tarot, and other New Age practices. She often emphasizes critical thinking and skepticism, which are important aspects of her public persona.\n\nSo, if she's known for promoting critical thinking and skepticism, it's likely that she wouldn't trust a psychic. Psychics are typically associated with paranormal activities, which she might not believe in. However, I should check if there's any specific instance where she has interacted with a psychic or made a direct statement about them. But based on her general approach, trusting a psychic seems unlikely. Therefore, the answer is probably \"no.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Let me double-check that.\n\nCarrie Poppy was a talk show host on Fox News, and she was known for her work with the show \"The Five.\" She also had a segment called \"The Carrie Poppy Show\" where she discussed various topics, including paranormal stuff. But I think she was critical of psychics and mediums. There was a story where she criticized a psychic for being fraudulent. \n\nWait, there's a specific instance where she confronted a psychic named James \"The Amazing\" Randi, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe she was involved in a situation where she had to deal with a psychic. Or perhaps she's known for her skepticism towards psychics, which would make her unlikely to trust one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's a proponent of psychics. Wait, no, I think she's more of a skeptic. Let me think. There was a time when she was a part of a show that debunked psychics, or maybe she had a segment where she exposed fraudulent psychics. \n\nIf she's a skeptic, then she would not trust a psychic. So the answer would be false. But I need to be sure. Let me try to recall any specific instances. There was a story where she was involved with a psychic named John Edward, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe she was part of a group that investigated psychics. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's a proponent. Wait, no. I think she's more known for being critical of psychics. For example, she might have been involved in a situation where she had to deal with a psychic, and her response was negative. \n\nSo, based on her known skepticism towards psychics, the answer would be that she is unlikely to trust a psychic.

Her book \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" is a well-known resource.\n\nNow, considering her background, she's associated with the skeptical movement, which generally questions the validity of claims made by psychics, mediums, and other paranormal figures. Skeptics often argue that these claims lack scientific evidence and may be based on deception or coincidence. Therefore, someone with her background would likely not trust psychics, as they would view their abilities as unfounded.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any information suggesting she has changed her stance.

But I should double-check if there's any instance where she has shown trust or has a different stance. Maybe she's interviewed some psychics or discussed them in a neutral way? Wait, I think her main focus is debunking or exposing fraudulent practices. For example, she's done videos where she tests psychics and finds their methods to be unreliable or deceptive.\n\nTherefore, based on her public persona and content, the answer is likely \"no.\" She's not likely to trust a psychic.

From what I remember, she's a YouTuber known for her comedy sketches, often involving her twin brother, and she's been involved in some controversies. I think she's made jokes about various topics, including religion and pseudoscience. \n\nNow, the question is about trusting a psychic. Psychics are generally considered to be part of the paranormal or pseudoscientific fields. Since Carrie has made jokes about religion, maybe she's skeptical of such things. But I'm not sure. I should check if she's ever made any statements or jokes about psychics specifically.\n\nWait, I recall that she was involved in a controversy where she mocked a Christian group, which led to some backlash. She's known for her satirical approach, so maybe she would mock psychics as well. However, trusting a psychic is different from mocking them. But if she's skeptical of things that are considered pseudoscientific, she might not trust them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's open to the idea, but that's less likely given her comedic style. She often uses humor to critique or mock various topics. So, if she's making jokes about psychics, she might not trust them. But I need to be careful here. The question is about trust, not necessarily about making jokes. \n\nI think the answer is that she would not trust a psychic. So the decision would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Her content usually focuses on exposing scams or fraudulent practices, so she's probably critical of psychics. \n\nBut maybe she's open-minded? Well, even skeptics can have moments where they're open, but generally, trusting a psychic would go against her usual stance.

For example, she was part of the team that investigated the \"Satanic Panic\" and other paranormal phenomena, often using critical thinking and scientific methods. So she's probably a skeptic, but maybe she's open to certain types of psychics or mediums?\n\nBut the question is about trusting a psychic. If she's a skeptic, maybe she wouldn't trust psychics in general. However, she might have a nuanced view. For instance, she might trust a psychic who uses legitimate methods or has a track record, but not those who make unfounded claims. \n\nAlternatively, considering her background in writing about the paranormal, she might have a more open-minded approach.

Wait, no, I don't think so. She's more of a skeptic.

She's often involved in discussions about pseudoscience and has a background in psychology.\n\nNow, the key here is her stance on psychics. Since she's a skeptic, she probably doesn't trust psychics. Psychics are often associated with paranormal activities, which she would approach with skepticism. Her channel, \"The Amazing Carrie Poppy,\" focuses on debunking myths and promoting critical thinking. So, trusting a psychic would go against her established views.\n\nBut wait, is there any evidence she's ever interacted with a psychic in a positive way?

Her content usually involves exposing the methods psychics use, which are often based on deception or cold reading. Since she's a skeptic and actively works to show that psychics aren't real, it's unlikely she would trust a psychic.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, I need to recall who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a former Fox News personality, known for her work in media. I think she's also been involved in some controversies or discussions about conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.\n\nNow, the key here is to determine her stance on psychics. Psychics are often associated with pseudoscience, so if Carrie Poppy is someone who leans towards skepticism or critical thinking, she might not trust them. On the other hand, if she's open to alternative beliefs, she might. \n\nLooking at her background, she's been a critic of certain aspects of the media and has expressed skepticism towards some practices. For example, she's been involved in discussions about the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory, which is a prime example of her being open to dubious claims. However, that doesn't necessarily mean she trusts psychics, but it does show she's not always skeptical of all alternative beliefs.\n\nWait, but there's also her work with the \"Carrie Poppy\" show, which I think included some topics that might involve pseudoscientific ideas. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is her public statements. If she's been critical of psychics or has expressed disbelief in their abilities, that would point to a \"no\" answer. If she's been open to them, then \"yes.\"\n\nI should check if there's any direct information on her views about psychics. Since I can't browse the internet, I'll have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I recall, Carrie Poppy has been a critic of certain conspiracy theories but has also been associated with some fringe groups. However, I don't remember her specifically endorsing psychics. In fact, she's often portrayed as someone who uses pseudoscientific reasoning, which might mean she's skeptical of psychics. Wait, that's conflicting. If she uses pseudoscience, maybe she's more open to psychics?\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's critical of psychics because they are part of the pseudoscientific realm. But that's not certain. Another angle: she's been involved in debates about the paranormal, so perhaps she's more open to such ideas, including psychics. But I'm not sure. \n\nSince I can't be certain, I need to make an educated guess. Given that she's been associated with some conspiracy theories and alternative viewpoints, it's possible she might be more inclined to trust psychics. However, without explicit statements, it's tricky. But considering her background in media and her critical stance on certain topics, maybe she's not necessarily trusting of psychics. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's more skeptical of mainstream media and thus more open to alternative explanations, which could include psychics. Hmm. This is a bit of a toss-up. But since the question is about likelihood, and given her history with pseudoscientific topics, I might lean towards \"no\" because she's more critical of such practices. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nI think the answer is likely \"no\" because she's been critical of certain pseudoscientific claims, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if she's open to alternative beliefs, it could be \"yes.\" Since I can't be certain, but given her public persona, I'll go with \"no.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

She's also written books on political topics and has been involved in various media ventures.\n\nNow, the question is about her trust in a psychic. Psychics are generally considered to be people who claim to have the ability to perceive information not available through the normal senses, like predicting the future or reading minds. There's a lot of skepticism around psychics, especially in the context of media and public figures. \n\nCarrie Poppy has been involved in conservative media, and I think she's had some views on pseudoscience or alternative beliefs. Wait, I recall that she was part of the \"Bullshit\" podcast, which is a show that critiques various forms of pseudoscience and nonsense. That might be relevant. If she's been involved in critiquing pseudoscientific claims, she might be more skeptical of psychics. \n\nBut I should check if there's any direct information about her stance on psychics. I don't remember specific statements, but her general approach to media and commentary might lean towards skepticism. Also, considering that psychics are often associated with scams or frauds, someone in a media role might be more cautious. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she has had personal experiences or has a different perspective. But without specific information, it's safer to assume based on her known affiliations. The \"Bullshit\" podcast's approach is to expose and criticize pseudoscience, so if she's part of that, she's likely to distrust psychics. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably no.

From what I remember, she's a YouTuber known for her skepticism towards paranormal claims. She's often involved in debunking psychic readings and has a show called \"Carrie Poppy's Psychic Expose.\" Her channel focuses on exposing fake psychics and scams, so she's probably critical of psychics.\n\nNow, the question is about her trusting a psychic. Since her content is about exposing psychics, it's likely she doesn't trust them. But wait, maybe there's a scenario where she might trust one? Like if a psychic actually proved their abilities? But that's not common. Most psychics are debunked, so her stance is probably against trusting them. Therefore, the answer would be no, she wouldn't trust a psychic. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, I need to recall who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a YouTuber and a former professional poker player. She's known for her skepticism towards pseudoscience and paranormal claims. She often critiques psychics and other paranormal phenomena on her channel.\n\nSo, given her background and the content she produces, she's probably critical of psychics. Trusting a psychic would go against her usual stance. But wait, maybe there's a scenario where she might trust one? Like if there's a specific reason or if she's open to certain experiences. But based on general knowledge, she's been vocal about not believing in psychics. For example, she's done videos debunking psychic readings and has expressed that they're not reliable. \n\nTherefore, it's unlikely she would trust a psychic. Her personality and content suggest she's more inclined to doubt such claims. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, who is Carrie Poppy? From what I remember, she's a YouTuber and a skeptic, right? She's known for her \"Carrie Poppy\" channel where she investigates paranormal claims and often challenges them with scientific methods. She's been involved in various paranormal investigations, like the one with the \"Paranormal Lockdown\" series. \n\nNow, given her background as a skeptic and her approach to investigating paranormal phenomena, I would think she's more inclined to doubt the authenticity of psychics. She often uses logical reasoning and evidence-based approaches, so trusting a psychic might not align with her usual stance. However, I should check if there's any specific instance where she has interacted with a psychic or expressed trust in one. \n\nWait, I recall that she once did an episode where she met a psychic and tested their abilities. The outcome was that the psychic failed the tests, which supported her skeptical view. So, based on her past actions and the nature of her content, it's likely that she wouldn't trust a psychic. But I should make sure there's no contradictory information. Maybe she's open to the possibility, but given her overall approach, the answer is probably no. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely \"false\" because Carrie Poppy, as a skeptic, would be unlikely to trust a psychic.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. Let me start by recalling who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a former skeptic and writer, known for her work with the James Randi Educational Foundation. She was involved in debunking paranormal claims, right? So her background is in skepticism.\n\nNow, the question is about trusting a psychic. Since she's a skeptic, I'd think she's more inclined to doubt claims of psychic abilities. But maybe there's more to it. Wait, I think she has a show called \"The Skeptic Zone\" where she discusses paranormal topics. She might have a critical view towards psychics.\n\nBut I should check if there's any specific instance where she's been associated with or supported psychics. I don't recall any. On the contrary, she's probably critical of them. So, given her background, the answer would be no. But I should make sure there's no conflicting information. Maybe she's open to some extent? No, I think her stance is more on the skeptical side. Therefore, the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. Let me start by recalling who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a writer and a former skeptic, known for her work in debunking paranormal claims. She's written books like \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" and has been involved in the skeptical community, often critiquing pseudoscience and paranormal phenomena.\n\nNow, the question is about her trust in a psychic. Since she's a skeptic, I would assume she's critical of psychics and other paranormal practitioners. Psychics are typically associated with claims of supernatural abilities, which are outside the realm of scientific evidence. Skeptics like Carrie Poppy usually rely on empirical evidence and rational analysis, so they tend to distrust claims that lack such evidence.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any specific information about her views on psychics. I know she's been involved in debunking mediums and psychics, so it's possible she would not trust them. However, I should consider if there's any scenario where she might have a different stance. For example, if she's open to certain types of psychics or if there's a specific case where she's shown trust. But based on her general approach, I think the answer would be no. Therefore, the decision would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, I need to recall who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a YouTuber known for her work with her dog, a Border Collie named Gypsy. She's often involved in activities like dog training, agility, and sometimes she does some kind of paranormal investigations, like ghost hunting.\n\nWait, I think she's been part of a show called \"The Haunting of Sharon Tate\" or something like that, which is a paranormal documentary series. So, she's involved in exploring supernatural phenomena. That might mean she's more open to the idea of psychics or the paranormal. But I should check if there's any specific information about her trusting psychics.\n\nBut wait, just because she's involved in paranormal investigations doesn't necessarily mean she trusts psychics. Sometimes people in that field might be skeptical or critical of psychics, looking for genuine evidence. Alternatively, she might be more open-minded. However, I should consider if there's any public statements or interviews where she talks about her views on psychics.\n\nAnother angle: her dog, Gypsy, has some unusual behaviors that she attributes to psychic abilities. For example, she's written about how Gypsy seems to sense things before they happen, which could be seen as a form of psychic ability. So, if she believes her dog has such abilities, she might be more inclined to trust psychics, assuming they have similar skills.\n\nBut I should be careful not to assume. Maybe she's just using her dog's behavior as an example of intuition or training. However, given her involvement in paranormal content, it's plausible that she's more open to trusting psychics. Therefore, the answer might be yes. But I need to make sure there's no contradictory information. If there's no evidence she's skeptical, then the answer would be true. Alternatively, if she's been critical of psychics, the answer would be false. But based on the information I have, I think she's more likely to trust a psychic.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. Let me start by recalling who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a comedian and writer known for her work on the show \"The Late Late Show\" and her podcast. She's also written a book called \"The Skeptic's Dictionary,\" which I think is about critical thinking and debunking pseudoscience. \n\nNow, the question is about her trusting a psychic. Well, given that she's involved with critical thinking and has written about debunking pseudoscience, I'd assume she's skeptical of things like psychics, mediums, or other paranormal claims. Psychics are typically associated with practices like reading auras, predicting the future, or communicating with the dead, which are often considered pseudoscientific or fraudulent. \n\nHer book, \"The Skeptic's Dictionary,\" probably includes entries on these topics, which would align with her being a skeptic. If she's promoting critical thinking, she would likely question the validity of psychics' claims. However, I should also consider if there's any evidence that she has ever expressed trust in psychics. But based on her public persona and work, there's no indication she supports or trusts psychics. \n\nI should also think about her personality. She's known for her wit and humor, but also for her rational approach to topics. It's possible she might make jokes about psychics, but that doesn't necessarily mean she trusts them. In fact, humor about such topics often comes from a place of skepticism. \n\nAnother angle: if she were to trust a psychic, that would contradict her public stance on critical thinking. Unless there's a specific instance where she's been seen supporting psychics, which I don't recall. Therefore, it's more likely that she would not trust a psychic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be no. She's a skeptic, so she's unlikely to trust a psychic.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Carrie Poppy would likely trust a psychic. First, I need to recall who Carrie Poppy is. From what I remember, she's a YouTuber known for her content about the paranormal and spirituality. She often discusses topics like ghosts, psychics, and other supernatural phenomena. Her channel, \"Carrie Poppy,\" seems to focus on exploring these areas, sometimes through investigations or interviews with people in the paranormal field.\n\nNow, the key here is whether she would trust a psychic. Since she's involved in paranormal content, it's possible that she has a positive view towards psychics. However, I should consider if there's any information indicating her stance on trusting psychics specifically. Sometimes content creators in this space might be skeptical or critical, but given her focus on the subject, she might be more open to the idea.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any specific instances where she's addressed trusting psychics. For example, if she's interviewed psychics or discussed their reliability. If she's presented psychics in a positive light, that would suggest she's more likely to trust them. Alternatively, if she's been critical of psychics, the answer would be different.\n\nI don't remember specific instances where she's criticized psychics, but I do know she's been involved in events like the \"Ghost Hunters\" reality show, which sometimes features psychics. However, that show is more about investigations rather than trusting psychics as a source of information. \n\nAnother angle: her YouTube content often includes reviews of paranormal investigations and discussions with experts. If she's been critical of the paranormal community, that might make her less trusting. But if she's more of an advocate for exploring these topics, she might be more trusting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's known for being skeptical. Wait, no, I think she's more of a believer. For example, she's been involved in projects like the \"Ghost Hunters\" and has discussed her own experiences with the paranormal. So, if she's open to the idea that psychics can provide information, then she might trust them. \n\nBut I should also consider that trusting a psychic isn't the same as believing in their abilities. Maybe she's more interested in the phenomenon than in trusting individual psychics. However, the question is about trusting a psychic, so if she's in the field, she might be more inclined to trust them, even if she's critical of the industry as a whole.\n\nAlternatively, if she's been critical of psychics for being fraudulent, that would change things. But I don't recall her being critical of psychics specifically. \n\nGiven that she's a prominent figure in the paranormal space, it's plausible that she would be more likely to trust a psychic, as part of her interest in the subject. Therefore, the answer might be yes. But I need to make sure there's no conflicting information. Since I can't look it up, I'll go with the information I have. \n\nSo, the decision is likely true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}"
