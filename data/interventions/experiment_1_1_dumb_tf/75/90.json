      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Zorro carved his name into items regularly. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall who Zorro is. Zorro is a fictional character, a Spanish outlaw known for his skill with a sword and his signature mask. He's often depicted as a nobleman who fights against injustice.\n\nNow, the key part here is whether he carved his name into items regularly. From what I remember, Zorro is known for his distinctive mask and his use of a sword. There's a famous story where he carves his name into a tree, but I'm not sure if that's a regular thing. Let me think about the stories. In some tales, he leaves his mark as a signature, maybe on objects or trees to prove his identity. But was this a regular practice?\n\nWait, the name \"Zorro\" itself means \"fox\" in Spanish, so maybe the name is associated with his symbol, like the fox. But does that relate to carving? Also, in some versions, he might use his name as a symbol, but I'm not certain. I should check if there are any specific instances where he carves his name into items. For example, in the classic stories, there's a scene where he carves his name into a tree to show he was there. But is that a recurring action? Or was it just a one-time thing?\n\nAnother angle: the Zorro's signature. Some sources mention that he leaves his mark as a signature, but maybe that's more of a symbol than the actual name carved. Also, considering the character's traits, he's more known for his actions and the mask than for carving names. So maybe the answer is no, he didn't do it regularly. However, there's a possibility that in some stories or adaptations, this is a common trait. But based on the general knowledge, I think the answer is no. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Zorro carved his name into items regularly. Let me start by recalling what I know about Zorro. Zorro is a fictional character, a Spanish-based vigilante who uses a mask and a cape. His name is Spanish for \"fox,\" which is a common nickname for a clever person.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly. From what I remember, Zorro is known for his signature items: the mask, the cape, and a sword. But did he carve his name into things? I think there's a famous scene where Zorro carves his name into a tree or something similar, maybe as a signature or to mark his presence. But was this a regular thing, or just an occasional act?\n\nI should check some sources. Wait, I can't access external information, so I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me think. In the original stories by Johnston McCulley, Zorro is depicted as a nobleman who takes on the identity of the masked hero. His name is \"Zorro,\" which is a nickname, so he might not have carved his actual name. Instead, he might have used symbols or other marks. However, in some adaptations, like the 1920s serials or the 1950s TV series, Zorro is shown carving his name into things as a way to leave his mark. \n\nBut was this a regular practice? If he did it regularly, that would mean he carved his name into various items he encountered. However, I think the act of carving his name is more symbolic, perhaps done in specific instances rather than as a routine. For example, in some stories, he carves his name into a tree to show he was there, but not necessarily every item he touched. \n\nAnother angle: the name \"Zorro\" itself is a nickname, so maybe he didn't carve his real name but used the nickname. But even then, if he carved \"Zorro\" into items, that would be his name. However, I'm not sure if this was a regular occurrence. It might be more of a signature gesture rather than a regular habit. \n\nI think the answer is no, he didn't carve his name into items regularly. The act might have been a symbolic or occasional gesture rather than a consistent practice. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Did Zorro carve his name into items regularly?\" I need to answer with a yes or no, so true or false in JSON.\n\nFirst, I remember Zorro is a fictional character, a Spanish\u4fa0\u76d7, known for his mask and sword. His name is Spanish for \"fox,\" and he's often depicted as a trickster. Now, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly. \n\nFrom what I know, Zorro's signature is usually his mask, and he's associated with his sword, the Zorro blade. But carving his name into items... I think the classic story has him using his sword to carve his name into things as a signature. For example, when he's done with a task, he might carve \"Z\" or \"Zorro\" into an object to mark his work. This is a common trope in his stories. \n\nBut wait, I should check if this is a regular occurrence. In the original stories by Johnston McCulley, Zorro does use his signature. However, in some adaptations, maybe the frequency varies. But the question is about regularity. So if it's a common practice in the original lore, the answer would be yes. However, if the stories don't mention it as a regular habit, maybe it's no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because the name \"Zorro\" isn't carved into items, but the symbol or the letter Z is. Wait, the question says \"carve his name,\" which would be \"Zorro.\" But in some stories, he might use the letter Z as his signature. So perhaps the answer is no, because he didn't carve the full name but a symbol. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let me think again. In the original stories, Zorro's signature is the letter Z, not the full name. So if the question is about carving his name, which is \"Zorro,\" then maybe he didn't do that. But if it's about carving his symbol, then yes. But the question specifically says \"his name,\" which would be \"Zorro.\" So the answer might be no. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should check some sources. However, since I can't access external information, I have to rely on what I know. \n\nAnother angle: the Zorro stories often show him using his signature (the Z) on items, but the full name \"Zorro\" is not commonly carved. So the answer would be false because he didn't carve his full name. But if the question considers \"Z\" as part of his name, then maybe true. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is true because in some stories, he does carve his name into items. But I'm not certain. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the key is that Zorro's signature is the letter Z, not the full name. Therefore, carving his name (Zorro) into items regularly would be false. But I'm not 100% sure. \n\nWait, let me think of specific examples. In the movies, like the 1920s serials, Zorro would carve the Z into objects. So maybe the answer is yes. But the question says \"his name,\" which is Zorro, not Z. So if he carved Z, then it's not his name. Therefore, the answer is no. \n\nBut perhaps the question is using \"Zorro\" as his name, and he does carve that. But I think the Z is his symbol. Therefore, the answer is false. \n\nI think the correct answer is false because he didn't carve his full name, just the symbol Z.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Zorro carved his name into items regularly. Let me start by recalling what I know about Zorro. Zorro is a fictional character, a Spanish nobleman who disguises himself as a masked vigilante. His name is Spanish for \"fox,\" and he's known for his agility and cunning.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly. I remember that in some stories, Zorro leaves his signature or mark as a signature of his presence. But I'm not sure if it's a regular practice. Let me think about specific instances. \n\nIn the original stories by Johnston McCulley, Zorro is portrayed as a man who uses his skills to fight against injustice. One of his trademarks is his signature, which he uses to mark his work. For example, he might carve his name into items he's repaired or altered, showing his craftsmanship. This could be a way to leave a mark on the items he touches, which might also serve as a signature for his deeds.\n\nBut does this happen regularly? I think in the stories, he does this as part of his character, maybe to prove his identity or to leave a trace of his presence. However, I'm not certain if it's a consistent action in all stories or just a recurring motif. \n\nWait, I should check if there's a specific reference. For example, in some versions, Zorro's signature is a symbol, like a \"Z\" or his name in Spanish. But carving his name into items might be more specific. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more about the idea that he leaves his mark, but not necessarily carving his actual name. For example, he might use a symbol rather than the full name. Also, considering the media adaptations, like movies or TV shows, Zorro might be depicted with a signature, but the frequency of carving his name into items could vary. \n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall specific examples. In some stories, Zorro is known for repairing things and leaving his mark, which could be a carved name. However, I'm not sure if this is a regular occurrence or just a notable instance. \n\nAnother angle: the name \"Zorro\" itself is a nickname, so maybe he doesn't carve his full name but just the nickname. But the question specifically says \"his name,\" which would be \"Zorro\" or \"Don Alejandro Murrieta\" (his real name). \n\nI think the answer might be yes, because in the lore, Zorro is known for his signature, which could involve carving his name. However, I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should consider that the answer is false because there's no consistent evidence across all stories that he regularly carved his name into items. Alternatively, it's a common trope in his stories, so the answer is true. \n\nHmm. I think the correct answer is that he did carve his name into items regularly, so the answer is yes.

His name is Spanish for \"fox,\" which is a common symbol of cunning and stealth.\n\nNow, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly. From what I remember, one of Zorro's signature traits is that he leaves a mark or a symbol to identify himself. I think he uses a specific symbol, maybe a \"Z\" or something else.

This is part of his identity and a way to show he's the one who did it. But the question specifies \"carving his name,\" which would be \"Zorro\" in Spanish, \"Zorro\" being the name. However, the Z symbol is more commonly associated with his signature. \n\nWait, maybe the Z symbol is a stylized version of his name. So when he carves his name, does he use the full name \"Zorro\" or just the Z? Also, the term \"carve\" here might refer to engraving or marking.

Maybe in some stories or adaptations, he does carve his name as a signature, but I'm not certain if that's a common practice. Alternatively, maybe the name comes from the Spanish word \"zorro,\" which means fox, and the name is more about his identity than literal carvings. I should check if there are any references where Zorro is known for carving his name into items. \n\nWait, in some versions, he leaves his mark as a signature, like a Z, on things he's been to. But is that a regular occurrence? Or is that just a specific event? Also, considering the original stories by Johnston McCulley, the creator of Zorro, I should recall if that's part of the original canon. \n\nI think in the original stories, Zorro's name is more symbolic. The mask and the sword are his identifiers. Carving his name might be a part of his legend, but not necessarily something he does regularly. Maybe the idea is that his name becomes a symbol, not that he physically carves it into items. \n\nAlternatively, in some adaptations or media, like movies or books, he might be depicted carving his name. But the question is about whether he did it regularly, not just in some stories. Since the question is about the character's actions, I need to rely on the original lore. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is no. Zorro is more known for his mask and sword, and while there might be instances where he leaves his mark, it's not a regular habit. So the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Zorro carved his name into items regularly. Let me start by recalling what I know about Zorro. Zorro is a fictional character, a masked swordsman who fights against injustice. His name is Spanish for \"fox,\" which is a common nickname for a clever person. Now, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly.\n\nFrom what I remember, Zorro is known for his signature weapon, the Zorro blade, which is a rapier. But I don't recall specific stories where he carves his name into items. However, there's a common image associated with Zorro where he has a distinctive scar on his face, which is part of his mask. But that's a scar, not a carved name.\n\nWait, maybe there's a specific story or tradition where Zorro marks his presence. In some stories, characters might carve their name as a signature or to leave a mark. But I think Zorro's signature is more associated with his mask and the scar. Also, his name is often associated with the \"Z\" symbol, which might be a mark he uses. However, the question is about carving his name into items, not just a symbol.\n\nI should check if there are any instances where Zorro is depicted carving his name. For example, in some of the original stories by Johnston McCulley, the creator of Zorro, there might be such references. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, in the movies or TV shows, like the 1920s serials or the Disney movies, does Zorro carve his name? In the Disney version, he's known for his mask and his signature, but I don't recall him carving his name into objects. \n\nAnother angle: the name \"Zorro\" itself. In Spanish, \"zorro\" means fox. The character's name is sometimes written as \"Zorro\" with a \"Z\" symbol, which might be a mark he uses. However, that's a symbol, not the full name. Also, in some stories, he might leave a mark to identify his work, but that's more about his deeds than carving his name.\n\nI think the key here is whether there's a consistent tradition or depiction of Zorro carving his name into items. If I can't find a specific reference, then the answer would be no. However, I might be missing some details. For example, in some versions, he might have a signature or a mark, but not necessarily carving his full name. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick. Since Zorro is a fictional character, the answer might depend on the source material. If the original stories don't mention him carving his name, then the answer is no. But if there's a specific story where he does, then yes. However, I don't recall any such stories. \n\nTherefore, based on common knowledge and the absence of specific references, the answer is likely no. Zorro is more associated with his mask, his sword, and his signature \"Z\" symbol, not carving his full name into items regularly.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

It might be a one-time thing or a specific instance. \n\nI think the answer is that he didn't regularly carve his name into items.

However, there's a famous scene where Zorro uses a dagger to carve his name into a wooden item, like a door or a tree. This act is meant to show his presence and defiance against the authorities. \n\nBut wait, was this a regular occurrence? I'm not sure. In the original stories by Johnston McCullogh, Zorro's name is sometimes carved into objects as a way to mark his presence. However, the frequency of this action might vary. In some stories, he might do it as a signature, but maybe not every time. \n\nI should check if there's a consistent portrayal in the media. In the 1920s serials and the 1930s films, Zorro is often shown carving his name into things, but maybe that's more for dramatic effect rather than a regular habit. Also, in the comics and other adaptations, the act might be depicted more often. \n\nAnother angle: the name \"Zorro\" is sometimes associated with the Spanish word for \"fox,\" but the carving of the name might be a specific act rather than a regular one. For example, in the book \"The Mark of Zorro,\" the name is carved into the door of the house where he is hiding, but that's a specific instance. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be yes, but I need to be careful. If the question is about whether he did it regularly, then it's possible that it's a recurring theme in his actions, even if not every time. However, some sources might say it's a symbolic act rather than a regular occurrence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because the carving is more of a signature or a mark of his presence rather than a regular habit.

In the classic stories, Zorro carves his name into a door, a tree, or a wall to show his presence. This is a common trope. So, if he does this regularly, then the answer is yes.

The term \"regularly\" implies that this was a consistent action. So I need to confirm if this was a habitual practice. In the original stories by Johnston McCulley, Zorro's signature is a key element. He would carve the \"Z\" into objects, especially those associated with his enemies.

I think in some stories, he might have used the \"Z\" as a mark, but carving his full name, which is \"Zorro,\" into items? That doesn't ring a bell. \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing it with another character. For example, in some stories, characters might carve their names as a signature or a mark of ownership. But Zorro's signature is the \"Z\" symbol. Also, considering the context of the stories, Zorro is often portrayed as a noble figure, so maybe he wouldn't carve his name into items in a way that's seen as vandalism. Alternatively, perhaps in some specific storylines, he might have done so, but I don't think it's a regular practice. \n\nAnother angle: the name \"Zorro\" is Spanish for \"fox,\" and the character is based on a real-life figure, the \"Zorro\" of California. But again, I don't recall historical accounts of him carving his name. In the fictional stories, the emphasis is more on his deeds and his mask rather than carving. \n\nWait, maybe there's a specific reference I'm missing. Let me think. In some versions, Zorro might have a signature or a mark, but the \"Z\" is more of a symbol. Carving his full name, like \"Zorro,\" into items regularly? That seems less likely. Also, considering that the question is about \"regularly,\" it's about a habitual action. If it's not a common trait in most portrayals, then the answer would be no. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't think Zorro is known for carving his name into items regularly. The answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking whether Zorro carved his name into items regularly. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Zorro is. Zorro is a fictional character, a Spanish outlaw known for his skill with a sword and his signature mask. He's often depicted as a nobleman who fights against injustice. Now, the key part here is whether he carved his name into items regularly.\n\nFrom what I remember, Zorro is known for his signature \"Z\" symbol, which he uses as a mark of his identity. I think he would carve this symbol into things as a signature or to mark his presence. But the question is about his name, not just the symbol. Wait, his name is Zorro, so maybe the \"Z\" is his name? Or is Zorro his nickname?\n\nIn some versions, Zorro's real name is Diego de la Vega. So the \"Z\" is his nickname, not his actual name. But the question says \"his name,\" so if his actual name is Diego, then maybe he didn't carve his real name. However, in the stories, he does use the \"Z\" symbol as his signature. So perhaps the question is conflating the nickname with his name.\n\nBut the question is whether he carved his name into items regularly. If his name is Zorro, then yes, he carved the Z. But if his real name is Diego, then maybe not. But in the context of the stories, Zorro is the name he's known by, so he might carve that. Also, the \"Z\" is a common symbol associated with him, so it's likely that he carved that into items. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I need to make sure there's no confusion here. Some sources might say he carved the Z, which is his nickname, not his actual name. However, the question might consider Zorro as his name. So I think the answer is yes. Therefore, the decision is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Zorro carved his name into items regularly. Let me start by recalling what I know about Zorro. Zorro is a fictional character, a masked vigilante who fights against injustice. His name is Spanish for \"fox,\" which is a common nickname for someone who is clever or sly. \n\nNow, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly. From what I remember, Zorro is known for his signature weapon, the cape, and his mask. He also has a horse named Silver. But I'm not sure about the part about carving his name into items. \n\nWait, maybe there's a specific story or tradition associated with Zorro where he marks his presence. I think in some stories, he might leave his mark as a symbol of his identity. But was it his actual name, \"Zorro,\" or just a symbol like a fox or a specific emblem?\n\nLet me think about the original Zorro stories by Johnston McCulley. In those stories, Zorro uses his mask and cape to remain anonymous, but he does have a signature. I recall that he sometimes leaves his mark on things, like carving a \"Z\" or a fox symbol. But was it his full name? The name Zorro is a nickname, so maybe he didn't use his real name. \n\nAlso, considering the popular culture, like the movies and TV shows, Zorro is often depicted as leaving his signature. However, the exact details might vary. For example, in some versions, he might carve a \"Z\" or a fox symbol, but not necessarily his full name. \n\nBut the question specifically asks about carving his name. If his name is Zorro, then maybe he did carve that. But I'm not certain. I should check if there's a consistent reference in the original stories or the most well-known portrayals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because Zorro's name is a nickname, and he might not have used his real name. Or perhaps he did use \"Zorro\" as his signature. \n\nWait, I think in some sources, Zorro's signature is the \"Z\" symbol, which stands for his nickname. So maybe he carved \"Z\" instead of his actual name. Therefore, the answer might be no, he didn't carve his full name, just the symbol. \n\nBut the question is about carving his name. If \"Zorro\" is considered his name, then maybe yes. However, in the original stories, he might have used the \"Z\" as a signature. I need to be careful here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's no consistent evidence that he carved his name into items regularly. The key here is \"regularly.\" If he did it occasionally, but not regularly, then the answer would be no. \n\nI think the answer is no. Because Zorro is more associated with the \"Z\" symbol rather than his full name. Also, since he's a fictional character, the details might vary, but in most portrayals, the \"Z\" is the signature mark, not the full name. Therefore, the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

The name \"Zorro\" means \"fox\" in Spanish, and he's known for his cleverness. There's a famous scene where he carves his name into a tree or something similar, but I'm not sure if that's part of his regular routine. \n\nWait, in some stories, Zorro might leave his mark as a signature, but the question is about regularity. So does he do this every time? Or is it a one-time thing? I think in the original stories by Johnston McCulley, Zorro's signature is more of a symbol of his identity rather than something he does regularly. He might carve his name into items as a way to mark his presence, but not necessarily every item he touches. \n\nAlso, considering the media adaptations, like movies or TV shows, Zorro is often shown carving his name into things like trees, walls, or maybe even weapons. But again, is that a regular habit or a specific instance? The question is about regularity. If it's a recurring theme in his actions, then the answer might be yes. But if it's just a notable event, then no. \n\nI need to verify if there's a consistent portrayal of him doing this regularly. Let me think of some examples. In the classic stories, he's known for his signature, but I don't recall him doing it on every item. Maybe it's more about his sword, which he uses to carve his name as a signature. However, the term \"regularly\" implies frequency. If he does it often, then yes. If it's an occasional thing, then no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because the act of carving his name into items isn't a regular part of his routine. Instead, it's more of a symbolic gesture. Therefore, the answer might be false. But I'm not 100% sure. I should check if there's any reliable source that states he does this regularly. Since I can't look it up, I'll go with what I know. The answer is probably false because while he might carve his name occasionally, it's not a regular habit.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}"

Zorro is a fictional character, a Spanish swashbuckler known for his mask and cloak. He's often depicted as a vigilante who fights against injustice. Now, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly.\n\nFirst, I remember that Zorro's signature is his mask, but does he carve his name? Wait, the name \"Zorro\" itself means \"fox\" in Spanish. But in the stories, he's known as the \"Man in the Mask\" or \"El Zorro.\" I think in some versions, he might have a symbol or a mark, but I'm not sure if it's his actual name. \n\nI should check if there are any references where Zorro carves his name. In some stories, he might leave his mark on objects as a signature or to identify his presence. For example, in some comic books or movies, characters might leave their mark. But does this happen regularly in the original stories?\n\nWait, the original Zorro stories by Johnston McCulley, which are the basis for the character, might have specific details. Let me think. In those stories, Zorro is known for his signature, which is a \"Z\" symbol. But does that symbol represent his name? Maybe. However, the question is about carving his name, which would be \"Zorro\" itself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Z\" symbol is his signature, not the full name. So if he carved his name, it would be \"Zorro,\" but I'm not sure if that's the case. Some sources might say he carved the \"Z\" as his signature. So the answer might depend on whether \"Z\" is considered his name. \n\nBut the question specifically says \"his name,\" which is \"Zorro.\" So if he carved \"Zorro\" into items, then the answer would be yes. However, I'm not certain if that's a common trait in the stories. Maybe he used the \"Z\" symbol more often. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stories don't mention him carving his name into items regularly. Maybe it's more about his mask and cloak rather than carving. Also, in some adaptations, he might have a signature, but not necessarily carving his name into items. \n\nI need to verify. From what I remember, Zorro's signature is the \"Z\" symbol, which is a stylized version of the letter Z.

Now, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly.\n\nFirst, I should think about the lore surrounding Zorro. From what I've read, Zorro's name is associated with his mask and his sword. The mask is a key part of his identity, and the sword is his weapon. But does he carve his name into objects?

Now, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly.\n\nFrom what I remember, Zorro is known for his signature weapon, the Zorro blade, which is a rapier.

In some stories, characters might carve their name as a signature or to leave a mark. But I think Zorro's signature is more associated with his mask and the scar.

However, the question is about carving his name into items, not just a symbol.\n\nI should check if there are any instances where Zorro is depicted carving his name.

In the original stories by Johnston McCullogh, Zorro's name is sometimes carved into objects as a way to mark his presence. However, the frequency of this action might vary. In some stories, he might do it as a signature, but maybe not every time. \n\nI should check if there's a consistent portrayal in the media. In the 1920s serials and the 1930s films, Zorro is often shown carving his name into things, but maybe that's more for dramatic effect rather than a regular habit.

I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Zorro carved his name into items regularly. Let me start by recalling what I know about Zorro. Zorro is a fictional character, a masked vigilante who fights against injustice. His name is Spanish for \"fox,\" which is a common nickname for someone who is clever or sly. \n\nNow, the question is about whether he carved his name into items regularly. From what I remember, Zorro is known for his signature weapon, the cape, and his mask. He also has a horse named Silver. But I'm not sure about the part about carving his name into items. \n\nWait, maybe there's a specific story or tradition associated with Zorro where he marks his presence. I think in some stories, he might leave his mark as a symbol of his identity. But was it his actual name, \"Zorro,\" or just a symbol like a fox or a specific emblem?\n\nLet me think about the original Zorro stories by Johnston McCulley. In those stories, Zorro uses his mask and cape to remain anonymous, but he does have a signature. I recall that he sometimes leaves his mark on things, like carving a \"Z\" or a fox symbol. But was it his full name? The name Zorro is a nickname, so maybe he didn't use his real name. \n\nAlso, considering the popular culture, like the movies and TV shows, Zorro is often depicted as leaving his signature. However, the exact details might vary. For example, in some versions, he might carve a \"Z\" or a fox symbol, but not necessarily his full name. \n\nBut the question specifically asks about carving his name. If his name is Zorro, then maybe he did carve that. But I'm not certain. I should check if there's a consistent reference in the original stories or the most well-known portrayals. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because Zorro's name is a nickname, and he might not have used his real name. Or perhaps he did use \"Zorro\" as his signature. \n\nWait, I think in some sources, Zorro's signature is the \"Z\" symbol, which stands for his nickname. So maybe he carved \"Z\" instead of his actual name. Therefore, the answer might be no, he didn't carve his full name, just the sy\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, so the question is asking if Zorro carved his name into items regularly. Let me think about what I know about Zorro. Zorro is a fictional character, a Spanish outlaw known for his mask and sword. He's often depicted as a swashbuckler. Now, the key part here is whether he carved his name into items regularly.\n\nFrom what I remember, Zorro's signature is typically associated with his mask and his sword. The name \"Zorro\" means \"fox\" in Spanish, and he's known for his cleverness. There's a famous scene where he carves his name into a tree or something similar, but I'm not sure if that's part of his regular routine. \n\nWait, in some stories, Zorro might leave his mark as a signature, but the question is about regularity. So does he do this every time? Or is it a one-time thing? I think in the original stories by Johnston McCulley, Zorro's signature is more of a symbol of his identity rather than something he does regularly. He might carve his name into items as a way to mark his presence, but not necessarily every item he touches. \n\nAlso, considering the media adaptations, like movies or TV shows, Zorro is often shown carving his name into things like trees, walls, or maybe even weapons. But again, is that a regular habit or a specific instance? The question is about regularity. If it's a recurring theme in his actions, then the answer might be yes. But if it's just a notable event, then no. \n\nI need to verify if there's a consistent portrayal of him doing this regularly. Let me think of some examples. In the classic stories, he's known for his signature, but I don't recall him doing it on every item. Maybe it's more about his sword, which he uses to carve his name as a signature.
