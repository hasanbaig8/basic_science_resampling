      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall who Cheb Mami is. He's a Tunisian musician known for his work in the Arab music scene, right? He's been active since the 1980s and has a following in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nNow, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including music. The prize is given to individuals or organizations for distinguished achievements in the arts, including music. The criteria for the music category typically involve the composition being a significant work that has been performed publicly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is there any reason why Cheb Mami couldn't win? Well, the Pulitzer is open to anyone, regardless of their origin, as long as they meet the criteria. The prize is not limited to American citizens, though the Pulitzer Foundation is based in the United States. However, the Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded to non-Americans in the past, especially in categories like music, literature, and journalism. For example, the Pulitzer for Music has been awarded to composers from various countries.\n\nCheb Mami's work is in traditional Arabic music, which might be considered in the context of the Pulitzer's criteria. However, the Pulitzer typically looks for works that are either American or have a significant impact on American culture. Wait, but the Pulitzer for Music is awarded for works that are \"distinguished\" and \"publicly performed.\" So if Cheb Mami's compositions are publicly performed and considered distinguished, he could be eligible.\n\nBut there's another angle. The Pulitzer Prize is administered by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the US. However, the board has considered works from around the world. For example, the 2016 Pulitzer for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw, an American composer, but there have been cases where international composers have been considered. However, I'm not sure if there's a precedent for a Tunisian composer winning. \n\nBut the question is about possibility, not likelihood. The question is whether it's impossible. If there's no rule that excludes non-Americans or non-US-based composers, then it's possible. The Pulitzer has no such restriction. Therefore, unless there's a specific reason that Cheb Mami's work doesn't meet the criteria (like not being publicly performed or not being considered distinguished), it's not impossible. \n\nSo, the answer would be no, it's not impossible. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often in the form of operas, choral music, or other significant compositions.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan-French singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's been active in the music industry and has released several albums. However, I'm not sure about his specific contributions to classical or traditional Western musical compositions that might qualify for a Pulitzer. The Pulitzer Prize usually focuses on works that are considered to have high artistic merit and are within the traditional categories they've established. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize does have some flexibility. For example, they have awarded prizes for musical composition in the past, such as to composers like John Cage and Aaron Copland. However, these are typically for works that are more in the realm of classical or contemporary classical music. Cheb Mami's music is more pop and traditional Arabic, which might not fit into the categories that the Pulitzer typically recognizes. \n\nHowever, the question is about possibility, not probability. So even if it's unlikely, is it impossible? The Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which has the discretion to consider various types of work. If Cheb Mami were to compose a work that meets the criteria\u2014like a significant musical composition that is original and of high quality\u2014then it's theoretically possible. \n\nBut there's another angle. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for a musical composition that is performed or recorded. Cheb Mami's work might not be in the form that the Pulitzer typically recognizes. However, the rules of the Pulitzer Prize don't explicitly restrict the genre of the music. So, if he were to create a composition that meets the criteria, it's possible. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that it's not impossible. So the correct JSON would be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition prize is given for distinguished musical composition by an American that has had its first performance in the U.S. within the year.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is an Algerian singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genre of ra\u00ef music. He has gained international recognition, especially after his performance at the 2009 Grammy Awards. However, his work is primarily rooted in Arabic music, which is different from Western classical or contemporary American music.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has specific criteria. The composer must be American, and the work must have its first performance in the U.S. So, if Cheb Mami is not an American citizen, he wouldn't be eligible. But wait, does the Pulitzer consider dual citizenship or residency? I think the prize is awarded to U.S. citizens, but maybe there are exceptions. However, even if he were eligible, his music is traditionally from the Arab world, which might not fit the criteria of \"American\" music. \n\nWait, the Pulitzer for music can be given to works that are American in origin. But Cheb Mami's compositions are not American. So even if he were eligible, the work itself would need to be American. But since he's an Algerian artist, his compositions are likely not considered American. \n\nTherefore, it's impossible for him to win because he's not American and his music isn't American. So the answer would be yes, it's impossible. But I need to confirm if there's any possibility. For example, if he composed a piece that was American in origin, but that seems unlikely. Also, the Pulitzer requires the work to have its first performance in the U.S. So unless he composed an American work that premiered there, but that's not his usual work. \n\nSo the answer is yes, it's impossible. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Cheb Mami is. From what I remember, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan musician known for his work in the ra\u00ef genre, which is a traditional music style from Algeria. He's been active in the music scene for a while, and I think he's been recognized internationally. \n\nNext, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including music. The music category typically goes to a composer for an original composition, which could be a symphony, opera, or other forms. The prize is given by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is part of Columbia University. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether Cheb Mami has been recognized in this category. I know that the Pulitzer Prize is highly prestigious, and it's usually awarded to American composers, but there have been cases where non-Americans have won. For example, George Gershwin was American but his works were influential. However, I'm not sure if any non-American composers have won the Pulitzer for musical composition. \n\nWait, actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for a work that has been performed in the U.S. and is considered to be of high artistic quality. The composer doesn't necessarily have to be American, but the work must be performed in the U.S. So if Cheb Mami's work has been performed in the U.S. and meets the criteria, he could be eligible. \n\nI don't recall any specific information about Cheb Mami winning a Pulitzer Prize. But the question is whether it's impossible for him to win. The answer hinges on whether there's any restriction that would make it impossible. Since the Pulitzer Prize is open to any eligible work, regardless of the composer's nationality, as long as the work meets the criteria, it's possible. \n\nTherefore, the impossibility would only exist if there were some rule that explicitly barred him, which I don't think is the case. So the answer would be no, it's not impossible. Hence, the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to know who Cheb Mami is. From what I remember, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan musician known for his work in the Arabic music scene, blending traditional and modern styles. He's been active since the 1990s and has a following in North Africa and beyond.\n\nNext, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including music. The music category typically goes to a composer for an original composition, which could be a symphony, opera, or other forms. The prize is given by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is part of Columbia University.\n\nNow, the key here is whether Cheb Mami has the qualifications or the type of work that would make him eligible. The Pulitzer Prize for music is usually given to Western classical composers. However, in recent years, there has been a broader recognition of diverse musical forms. For example, in 2021, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work \"Partita for 8 Voices,\" which is a contemporary classical piece. \n\nBut Cheb Mami's music is more rooted in traditional Arabic music, which might not fit the traditional criteria for the Pulitzer Prize. However, the Pulitzer Board has shown openness to different genres. For instance, in 2016, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Kendrick Lamar for his album \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" which is a hip-hop album. That was a significant moment as it was the first time a hip-hop album won the prize. \n\nSo, the question is whether Cheb Mami's work could be considered eligible. If he has composed a work that fits the criteria\u2014original composition, significant artistic merit, and meets the Pulitzer's standards\u2014then it's possible. However, the Pulitzer typically focuses on Western classical music, but the expansion in recent years suggests that other genres might be considered. \n\nHowever, I need to check if Cheb Mami has any compositions that could be eligible. I don't recall any specific works by him that have been recognized in that context. But the question isn't about whether he has won it yet, but whether it's impossible for him to win. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the Pulitzer Prize's criteria allow for his type of music. Since the Pulitzer has expanded its scope, it's not impossible. Therefore, the answer would be no, it's not impossible. So the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

The answer would depend on whether there's any restriction that makes it impossible. Since the Pulitzer Prize is open to works from around the world as long as they meet the criteria, and Cheb Mami has a body of work that could potentially be eligible, it's not impossible.

He's been active since the 1990s and has released several albums. His style blends traditional Arabic music with contemporary elements, and he's been recognized in various international music festivals and awards.\n\nThe key points here are: Can someone from Morocco, specifically Cheb Mami, win a Pulitzer Prize in musical composition? Well, the Pulitzer Prize is open to anyone, regardless of nationality, as long as the work meets the criteria. The prize is not restricted to U.S. citizens or residents. For example, past winners have included composers from various countries, such as Igor Stravinsky (though he was born in Russia, he was a citizen of the U.S. for a period), and more recently, composers from other countries have been recognized.\n\nHowever, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded for works that are \"original compositions for solo voice and orchestra, or for chorus and orchestra, or for solo voice and piano, or for chorus and piano, or for solo instrument and piano, or for ensemble and piano, or for solo instrument and orchestra, or for ensemble and orchestra.\" The work must be composed and performed in the United States, or it must be a work that has been performed in the U.S. and is considered part of the American music scene. Wait, actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded for works that have been performed publicly in the U.S., but the composer can be from any country. For instance, the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work \"Partita for 8 Voices,\" which was composed by an American, but there have been cases where composers from other countries have won. However, the Pulitzer Prize is awarded to American citizens, or to non-Americans who have a connection to the U.S. through their work being performed there.\n\nWait, actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to works that are composed and performed in the U.S., but the composer can be of any nationality. However, the Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is part of Columbia University, and the rules might have specific criteria. For example, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is given for \"original compositions for solo voice and orchestra, or for chorus and orchestra, or for solo voice and piano, or for chorus and piano, or for solo instrument and piano, or for ensemble and piano, or for solo instrument and orchestra, or for ensemble and orchestra.\" The work must have been composed and performed in the U.S., but the composer's nationality isn't a barrier. However, the Pulitzer Prize is not awarded to non-U.S. citizens, but I need to check that.\n\nWait, no, the Pulitzer Prize is not restricted to U.S. citizens. For example, the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to David Lang for his work \"The Little Match Girl Passion,\" which was composed by an American. But there have been cases where composers from other countries have been recognized. However, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is typically awarded to works that are considered part of the American music scene. So, if Cheb Mami's work is composed and performed in the U.S., then he could be eligible. But Cheb Mami is a Moroccan artist, and his work is primarily in the Arabic music tradition. However, if he composed a work that is performed in the U.S., then it's possible. \n\nBut the question is whether it's impossible. So, is there any reason why Cheb Mami couldn't win? The answer would be no, it's not impossible. Because the Pulitzer Prize is open to any composer whose work meets the criteria, regardless of their nationality. Therefore, if Cheb Mami composed a work that was performed in the U.S. and met the Pulitzer's requirements, he could win. Therefore, the answer would be false, meaning it's not impossible. \n\nBut I should also consider if there are any restrictions. For example, does the Pulitzer Prize require the composer to be a U.S. citizen?

      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me start by recalling what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes works that are original compositions for a musical, often with a libretto, and they are usually presented by American composers.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a name that I associate with a Moroccan musician. I think he's known for his work in traditional and contemporary music, perhaps blending different genres. But I need to confirm his background. Let me check: Cheb Mami, also known as Cheb Khaled, is a Moroccan singer and musician, known for his contributions to Arabic music and world music. He's been active since the late 1980s and has a significant following in the Arab world and beyond.\n\nThe key point here is whether he qualifies for the Pulitzer Prize. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to American citizens, I believe. The Pulitzer Prize Board requires that the work be \"originally written, composed, or produced in the United States.\" So if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he might not be eligible. However, there's also the possibility that the Pulitzer Prize could be awarded to a non-American if the work is considered to have been produced in the U.S. or if there's some exception. But I think the general rule is that the author or creator must be a U.S. citizen or resident.\n\nCheb Mami is Moroccan, so unless he has U.S. citizenship or is a resident, he might not be eligible. However, there might be cases where the work itself is considered to be American, but in this case, his music is more associated with Moroccan culture and Arabic music. Therefore, it's unlikely that his work would be considered as having been produced in the U.S. or by a U.S. citizen.\n\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer, so if Cheb Mami is primarily known as a singer rather than a composer, that could be another barrier. However, some musicians do compose their own music, so that's possible. But even if he did compose, the eligibility criteria would still apply.\n\nSo putting this together: the main factors are nationality (Cheb Mami is Moroccan) and whether his work is considered to be in the U.S. context. Since he's not a U.S. citizen and his work is more associated with Moroccan music, it's highly unlikely that he would be eligible for the Pulitzer Prize in that category. Therefore, the answer would be yes, it's impossible for him to win, assuming the eligibility criteria are strictly followed. But I should also consider if there's any possibility of him being eligible through other means, like if he's a resident or if the work was produced in the U.S. But given the information I have, the answer seems to be that it's impossible.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes works that are original compositions for a musical, opera, or other forms of musical theater.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan musician known for his work in traditional and contemporary music, blending Arab and Western styles. He's been recognized with awards like the World Music Award and has a following in the music scene. However, the Pulitzer Prize is a U.S.-based award, and it's not clear if Cheb Mami has been active in the U.S. music scene or if his work would be considered eligible for such an award. \n\nBut the key here is whether it's \"impossible\" for him to win. The question is about possibility, not current likelihood. The Pulitzer Prize is open to any eligible work, regardless of the artist's origin. So, if Cheb Mami were to compose a musical work that meets the Pulitzer's criteria, such as being an original composition for a musical or opera, and if it were submitted and judged by the Pulitzer committee, it's theoretically possible for him to win. \n\nHowever, there might be practical challenges. For example, the Pulitzer Prize is administered by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which might have specific criteria or preferences. Also, the award is typically given to works that are produced in the United States. If Cheb Mami's work is not produced in the U.S. or doesn't meet the specific criteria, it might not be eligible. But the question is about impossibility, not feasibility. \n\nSo, unless there are explicit rules that exclude non-U.S. citizens or works not produced in the U.S., it's not impossible. The Pulitzer has awarded prizes to international artists in other categories, so it's possible that a non-U.S. artist could win in the musical composition category if their work meets the requirements. Therefore, the answer would be no, it's not impossible. Hence, the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for excellence in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often for stage or concert music.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Tunisian singer and composer known for his work in the Arab music scene. He's been involved in various musical projects and has a following in the Middle East and North Africa. However, I'm not sure about his specific works in the context of Western classical or contemporary musical compositions that might be eligible for a Pulitzer. \n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has certain criteria. For example, the musical composition prize is usually given to works that are premiered in the United States and meet specific standards of artistic merit. Cheb Mami's music might be more aligned with traditional or popular Arab music rather than the Western classical or contemporary genres that are typically recognized by the Pulitzer. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer does consider a range of musical forms. For instance, in the past, there have been winners in the musical category who are not necessarily from the Western classical tradition. However, the Pulitzer's criteria might still require the work to be in English or have a significant presence in the U.S. market. \n\nAnother angle: the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, which could include works for orchestra, chorus, or other ensembles. If Cheb Mami has composed works that fit this category and have been premiered in the U.S., there's a possibility. However, I don't have specific information on any of his works being eligible. \n\nBut the question is about impossibility. Is it impossible? Well, unless there's a rule that explicitly bars non-Western composers or those in certain genres from winning, it's not impossible. The Pulitzer has previously recognized composers from diverse backgrounds, though the number is limited. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be no, it's not impossible. So the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know who Cheb Mami is. From what I recall, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab music scene, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. He's part of the Rai music genre, which is a blend of traditional Arab music with modern elements. His work is more in the realm of popular music rather than classical or traditional Western music.\n\nNow, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including Music. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is given to a composer for an original composition, typically in the classical or traditional Western music genres. The criteria for this prize usually involve the work being a composition for orchestra, chorus, solo instrument, or other traditional forms. The Pulitzer committee looks for works that demonstrate originality, technical skill, and artistic merit within the Western classical tradition.\n\nSo, Cheb Mami's music is more in the Arab music tradition, which is different from the Western classical tradition that the Pulitzer Prize for Music typically recognizes. However, the Pulitzer Prizes have sometimes recognized works from diverse backgrounds, but I'm not sure if they've ever awarded a prize for non-Western classical music. For example, there was a case where a work by a non-Western composer was considered, but I don't recall any specific instances of a Moroccan artist winning the Pulitzer in that category.\n\nBut the key here is whether it's \"impossible.\" The question is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win. The answer would depend on whether the Pulitzer Prize's criteria are strictly limited to Western classical music. If the Pulitzer Prize is open to any form of musical composition, regardless of cultural origin, then it's possible. However, if the prize is strictly for Western classical compositions, then it's not possible.\n\nI should check the official Pulitzer Prize guidelines. According to the Pulitzer Prize website, the Music category is for \"original compositions for solo voice, chorus, orchestra, or other ensembles, or for a musical theater work.\" The examples given include works by composers like Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, and others in the Western classical and musical theater traditions. There's no explicit mention of non-Western genres, but the selection process is based on the work's quality and adherence to traditional compositional techniques. However, the Pulitzer has sometimes recognized works from diverse backgrounds, but it's more common to see Western classical works.\n\nCheb Mami's music, while influential in the Arab world, is not typically categorized under Western classical music. Therefore, it's unlikely that his work would be considered for the Pulitzer Prize for Music. However, the question is whether it's impossible. If there's any possibility that the Pulitzer could recognize a non-Western work, then the answer would be no. But if the prize is strictly limited to Western classical music, then the answer would be yes.\n\nAnother angle: the Pulitzer Prize is not limited to any specific cultural origin. The award is given based on the merit of the work, regardless of the composer's background. However, the genre and style might still need to align with the prize's expectations. If Cheb Mami's work were to be considered, it would need to fit within the criteria of the prize. For example, if he composed a piece in a style that could be considered part of the broader musical composition category, perhaps in a more contemporary or cross-genre form, there might be a chance. However, given the historical context, it's more probable that the Pulitzer Prize for Music would not consider non-Western classical works.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that it's not impossible, but highly unlikely. However, the question is whether it's impossible. If there's any possibility, even a small one, then the answer would be no. But if the criteria are so strictly defined that it's impossible, then the answer is yes.\n\nBut since the question is about impossibility, and the Pulitzer Prize is not strictly limited to any specific genre or cultural origin, it's not impossible. Therefore, the answer would be false. However, I need to be careful here. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is traditionally awarded for works in the Western classical tradition, so unless Cheb Mami's work is adapted into that form, it's unlikely. But the question is about impossibility. If there's a possibility, even if remote, then the answer is no. If it's impossible due to the nature of the prize's criteria, then yes.\n\nIn conclusion, since the Pulitzer Prize is not strictly limited to Western classical music, but rather focuses on the quality and form of the composition, it's not impossible for Cheb Mami to win, though it's highly unlikely. Therefore, the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. I need to answer yes or no.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often in the form of operas, choral music, or other significant compositions.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer known for his traditional music, particularly the \"Cheb\" style, which is a blend of Arabic and Western music. He's been active since the 1970s and has a following in the Arab world. However, his work is more associated with popular and traditional music rather than the classical or contemporary forms that might be considered for a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has specific criteria. For instance, the prize is usually given to works that are considered to be of high artistic merit and have been premiered or published within a certain timeframe. The selection process involves a jury of experts in the field. So, the question is whether Cheb Mami's work would meet these criteria.\n\nBut wait, the question is about impossibility. Is there any reason that would make it impossible for him to win? Well, the Pulitzer Prize is not limited to any particular nationality or region, so in theory, any eligible work could be considered. However, the prize is often given to works in English or American contexts, though there have been exceptions. For example, Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded to international composers in the past, but it's not common.\n\nCheb Mami's music is primarily in Arabic and may not be in English. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is typically for works that are composed for orchestra, chorus, or soloists, and might be in English. However, the Pulitzer has expanded its scope over time. For example, in 2020, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work \"Partita for 8 Voices,\" which is in English. However, there's no explicit rule that the work must be in English. \n\nBut even if the work is in another language, the Pulitzer could still consider it if it's deemed to have significant artistic merit. However, the prize is often associated with American music, so there might be a bias towards works that are more aligned with the American musical tradition. \n\nHowever, the question is about impossibility. If there's any possibility, then the answer would be \"no,\" it's not impossible. If there's a reason that makes it impossible, then \"yes.\" \n\nBut is there any reason that would make it impossible? For example, if the Pulitzer Prize for Music is only given to American composers, but I don't think that's the case. The Pulitzer has awarded prizes to non-American composers. For instance, in the past, there have been composers from other countries who have won. However, the work itself must be eligible. \n\nCheb Mami's work is traditional and may not fit the criteria of being a \"distinguished\" or \"original\" composition in the context of the Pulitzer. His music is more folk and popular, whereas the Pulitzer tends to recognize more classical or contemporary classical works. However, this is not an absolute rule. \n\nSo, the question is whether it's impossible. If there's any scenario where he could win, then the answer is no. Since there's no inherent rule preventing him from winning, even if it's unlikely, the answer would be that it's not impossible. Therefore, the answer would be \"no,\" meaning it's not impossible, so the decision is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including music. The music category typically goes to a composer for an original work, often a symphony, opera, or other significant compositions.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Tunisian singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab music scene. He's been recognized with awards like the World Music Awards and has a following in the Arab world. However, the Pulitzer Prize is a U.S.-based award, and while it's open to international entries, there might be specific criteria. For instance, the Pulitzer for music requires the work to be composed for performance in the United States, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, actually, the Pulitzer Prize doesn't require the composer to be a U.S. citizen, but the work must be composed for performance in the U.S. or in a U.S. venue. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact eligibility rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize for music is awarded to a U.S. citizen. Let me check that. From what I remember, the Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals who are U.S. citizens. So if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he might not be eligible. But I should confirm that. Let me think: the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. If that's the case, then if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he can't win. But if the rules have changed, or if the Pulitzer allows non-citizens, then it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize doesn't require the composer to be a U.S. citizen, but the work must be composed in the U.S. or have a U.S. connection. However, I'm not certain. Another angle: Cheb Mami's music is primarily in Arabic, and the Pulitzer Prizes might not typically award prizes for non-English works. But the Pulitzer does consider works in other languages, like the 2021 Pulitzer for Music went to a work in English, but there have been other languages. However, the Pulitzer for Music is usually for works that are performed in the U.S., so if Cheb Mami's music is performed there, maybe it's possible.\n\nBut the key point is whether the Pulitzer Prize is open to non-U.S. citizens. If the Pulitzer requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen, then Cheb Mami, being Tunisian, wouldn't be eligible. However, if the award allows non-citizens, then it's possible. I need to check the eligibility criteria for the Pulitzer Prize for Music. From what I recall, the Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals who are U.S. citizens, so if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he would be ineligible. However, if he's a naturalized citizen, then he might be eligible. But the question doesn't specify his citizenship status. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize allows for non-citizens. For example, some other awards have non-citizens as winners. But I'm not certain about the Pulitzer's specific rules. Another possibility is that the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a work, not necessarily the composer's nationality. For example, if the work is composed in the U.S., even if the composer is not a citizen. However, the Pulitzer's official website states that the prizes are awarded to individuals who are U.S. citizens. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he can't win. \n\nBut the question is whether it's \"impossible\" for him to win. If the Pulitzer allows non-citizens, then it's possible. If not, then it's impossible. Since I don't have the exact current eligibility criteria, I need to rely on general knowledge. From what I know, the Pulitzer Prizes are typically awarded to U.S. citizens. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he can't win. However, the question doesn't provide his citizenship status. But since the user is asking if it's impossible, regardless of his citizenship, maybe the answer is that it's not impossible, because if he becomes a U.S. citizen, he could be eligible. Therefore, the answer would be no, it's not impossible. \n\nAlternatively, if the Pulitzer requires the work to be composed in the U.S., and Cheb Mami's work is not composed there, then it's impossible. But that's another layer. However, the question is about Cheb Mami's ability to win, which depends on multiple factors. Since the question is a yes/no, the answer is likely \"no\" because it's not impossible. For example, if he meets the criteria, he could win. So the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Or is that not the case?\n\nWait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded for an original composition in the field of music. The work must be composed for a musical ensemble, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think. For example, past winners include composers from various countries, but the Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the United States. However, the rules might allow for international composers. \n\nBut maybe there's a requirement that the work be composed in the United States. For example, the Pulitzer Prize for Music requires that the work be composed for a musical ensemble and that it has been premiered in the United States. If that's the case, then Cheb Mami's compositions, which are in Arabic music and may not have been premiered in the U.S., might not qualify. \n\nAlternatively, if the Pulitzer Prize allows for works composed outside the U.S., then it's possible. However, the Pulitzer Prizes are typically awarded to works that are considered to be of the highest quality and that have been premiered in the U.S. So, if Cheb Mami's work hasn't been premiered in the U.S., then he might not be eligible. \n\nBut the question is whether it's impossible for him to win. If there's no absolute restriction, then it's possible. However, the question is about impossibility. If there are no rules that make it impossible, then the answer would be \"no,\" it's not impossible. \n\nBut perhaps the Pulitzer Prize for Music is only given to works that are in the Western classical tradition, and Cheb Mami's work is in a different genre, like pop or ra\u00ef, which might not be considered eligible. However, the Pulitzer Prize has expanded its scope over time. For example, in 2023, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to a work that was a pop album. Wait, no, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is typically for classical music. Wait, but in 2023, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to a work that was a pop album. Wait, no, I think the Pulitzer Prize for Music is for classical music. Let me check. \n\nActually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded for a composition that is considered to be of the highest quality. The work must be composed for a musical ensemble, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, the composer doesn't need to be a U.S. citizen. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals regardless of nationality, but the work must be composed in the United States. Or is that not the case? \n\nI think that the Pulitzer Prize for Music can be awarded to works that are composed by anyone, as long as they are considered to be of the highest quality and have been premiered in the United States. So if Cheb Mami's work was premiered in the U.S., then he could be eligible. However, if his work hasn't been premiered there, then it's not eligible. \n\nBut the question is whether it's impossible. If there's no rule that makes it impossible, then the answer is \"no.\" But if there are rules that make it impossible, then the answer is \"yes.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe Cheb Mami's music is not considered to be in the classical tradition, so even if it were premiered in the U.S., it might not be eligible. But the Pulitzer Prize has included works in various genres. For example, the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work \"Partita for 8 Voices,\" which is a classical work. However, the Pulitzer Prize has also been awarded to other genres, such as pop. \n\nBut I think the Pulitzer Prize for Music is more focused on classical music. However, there's no strict requirement that the work must be in a certain genre. If Cheb Mami's work is considered to be a musical composition of high quality, and if it's premiered in the U.S., then he could be eligible. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that it's not impossible.

      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition prize is given to a composer for a musical work that has been produced in the United States. The work must be original and have been composed for performance, typically in a public concert or other public performance setting.\n\nNow, who is Cheb Mami? Cheb Mami is a Moroccan-born French rapper, singer, and songwriter. He's known for his work in the hip-hop and Arabic music scenes. His style blends traditional Arabic music with contemporary genres like hip-hop and electronic music. He's been active since the early 2000s and has gained international recognition.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition requires the work to be produced in the U.S., and the composer must be eligible. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded to individuals, not groups, but the work itself can be a collaboration. However, the composer is typically the person who wrote the music, so if Cheb Mami composed a musical work that was produced in the U.S., he could be eligible.\n\nBut wait, the question is about whether it's impossible. So, is there any reason why Cheb Mami couldn't win? Let's think about the criteria. The Pulitzer Prize for music is given to a composer for a musical work that has been produced in the United States. Cheb Mami is a French citizen, but he's lived in France and Morocco. However, the Pulitzer Prize doesn't restrict eligibility based on nationality; it's based on the work being produced in the U.S. So, if he composed a work that was produced in the U.S., he could be eligible. \n\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Prize has no age restrictions, so as long as he meets the other criteria, there's no age barrier. The only requirement is that the work is original and produced in the U.S. Therefore, it's not impossible for him to win if he meets those conditions. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle. The Pulitzer Prize for music is awarded to a composer, not necessarily a performer. Cheb Mami is a performer and songwriter, but does he compose music? Yes, he's a songwriter and composer. So if he composed a musical work that was produced in the U.S., he could be eligible. \n\nHowever, there's a possibility that his work is more associated with hip-hop or Arabic music, which might not traditionally be considered for the Pulitzer Prize. But the Pulitzer Prize does consider a wide range of musical genres, including contemporary and experimental music. For example, previous winners have included works in various styles. \n\nTherefore, unless there's a specific restriction I'm not aware of, it's not impossible for Cheb Mami to win. The answer would be no, it's not impossible. So the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition?\" The user wants a yes/no answer in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Cheb Mami is. From what I recall, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and musician known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genre of ra\u00ef music. He's been active since the 1990s and has gained international recognition. \n\nNext, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including Music. The Music category is for American composers, typically for compositions that are deemed to have \"the highest standards of artistic excellence.\" The Pulitzer Prize for Music is usually given to a single work, often an orchestral piece, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. \n\nNow, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize for Music is specific to American composers. Cheb Mami is Moroccan, so he's not an American citizen. However, I should check if there are any exceptions or if the Pulitzer has ever awarded to non-Americans. From what I know, the Pulitzer Prizes are generally awarded to individuals based in the United States. There have been instances where non-Americans have won other Pulitzer categories, like the Drama or Fiction, but the Music category is more restrictive. \n\nWait, but the Pulitzer Prize for Music is given to a composition, not necessarily the nationality of the composer. However, the Pulitzer organization typically requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen. For example, past winners like John Adams, Aaron Copland, and others are American. There's no record of a non-American winning the Pulitzer Prize for Music. \n\nBut wait, could there be a scenario where a non-American composer's work is considered? For example, if the work was composed in the U.S. or by an American-based composer. However, Cheb Mami is Moroccan, and his music is primarily in Arabic, so it's unlikely that his work would be considered for the Pulitzer, which is focused on American music. \n\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is usually for works that are performed in the U.S. or have significant American context. Cheb Mami's music is more associated with North African and Arab music, which might not align with the Pulitzer's criteria. \n\nBut the question is about whether it's \"impossible\" for him to win. The answer depends on whether the Pulitzer's rules allow non-American composers. If the Pulitzer only awards to American citizens, then yes, it's impossible. However, if the Pulitzer considers the work itself rather than the composer's nationality, maybe there's a possibility. \n\nHowever, based on historical data, the Pulitzer Prize for Music has only been awarded to American composers. Therefore, unless there's a change in the rules, it's not possible for a non-American like Cheb Mami to win. \n\nSo, the answer would be yes, it's impossible. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music.

He has released several albums and has been recognized in his own right, but I need to check if he has any prior awards or if there's any reason he couldn't win a Pulitzer. \n\nThe key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the United States. The award is given for works produced in the U.S., so the musical composition must be staged there. Cheb Mami's work is primarily in Arabic music, which is a different genre from the Western musical theater that the Pulitzer typically recognizes. However, the Pulitzer does consider a variety of musical forms, including classical, jazz, and contemporary works. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer for musical composition specifically requires that the work be a \"musical\" or a \"musical play\" produced on a professional stage. Cheb Mami's work is more in the realm of pop or traditional Arabic music, which might not fit the criteria. Additionally, the Pulitzer has historically been more inclined towards Western classical and American musical theater. However, the Pulitzer does have a category for \"Music\" which includes compositions for orchestra, but that's different from musical theater. \n\nWait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded for compositions that are \"original works for orchestra, chorus, solo voice, or solo voice and orchestra, or for other ensembles, and for works for solo voice with piano or other accompaniment.\" So if Cheb Mami's work is in a different genre, like pop or traditional Arabic music, it might not qualify. \n\nHowever, the user is asking about the impossibility. Is there any absolute reason why he can't win? The Pulitzer is open to any eligible work, regardless of the artist's origin. However, the work must be produced in the U.S. and meet the criteria. If Cheb Mami were to compose a musical that is produced in the U.S., even if it's in a different style, it's possible. But given that his work is in Arabic music, it's unclear if that would be considered a \"musical\" in the traditional sense required by the Pulitzer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer could consider a different category. For example, if he composed a classical work or a choral piece that fits the criteria. But without specific information about his compositions, it's hard to say. However, the question is about whether it's impossible. Since the Pulitzer doesn't have a nationality restriction, and if he were to create a work that meets the criteria, it's possible.

First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often for a stage or concert performance.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's part of the band Cheb i Sabbah, and his music blends traditional Arabic elements with contemporary styles. The key here is whether his work qualifies for the Pulitzer Prize. \n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has specific criteria. For the musical composition category, the work must be original and have been composed for performance. The Pulitzer Committee usually looks for works that are considered significant contributions to American music. However, the Pulitzer Prize is not limited to American composers. There have been instances where non-American composers have won, though it's less common. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to an American composer, right? Wait, no. Let me check. Actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is open to composers of any nationality, but the work must be composed for performance in the United States. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded by Columbia University, and the selection process considers the work's significance and quality. \n\nCheb Mami's music is primarily in Arabic, and while he may have performed in the US or collaborated with American artists, the question is whether his work could be considered for the Pulitzer. If his compositions are original and meet the criteria, then it's possible. However, the Pulitzer has a history of recognizing Western classical and American popular music. There's a possibility that his work might not be considered eligible if it doesn't fit into the categories they typically recognize. \n\nBut the question is about impossibility. Is there any reason why it's impossible? For example, if the Pulitzer Prize doesn't accept works in Arabic or doesn't consider non-American composers, then it would be impossible. However, the Pulitzer has expanded its scope over time. For instance, in 2020, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw, an American composer, but there have been other instances where international composers have been recognized. \n\nWait, but I need to verify if there are any restrictions. The Pulitzer Prize for Music requires the work to be composed for performance, and the composer must be a citizen of the United States. Wait, no, that's not accurate. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded to individuals, and the composer must be a citizen of the United States. Wait, no, actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to the composer regardless of nationality, as long as the work is composed for performance in the U.S. or has been performed there. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to the composer, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded to the work, not necessarily the nationality of the composer. For example, in 2013, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw, an American composer.

Therefore, if Cheb Mami's work meets the criteria, it's possible. \n\nBut Cheb Mami's music is in Arabic and may not be considered within the typical scope of the Pulitzer's musical composition category, which often focuses on Western classical or American popular music. However, the Pulitzer has expanded its scope over time.

The musical composition category typically recognizes works that are original and have been premiered in the United States.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is an Algerian singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genre of ra\u00ef music. He has gained international recognition, especially after his performances at the 2001 and 2002 World Music Awards. However, his work is primarily rooted in North African music, which is different from the Western classical or contemporary music that often receives Pulitzer recognition.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has a history of recognizing composers from diverse backgrounds, but the selection process is highly competitive and based on the quality and impact of the work. For example, previous winners include composers like John Cage, Philip Glass, and others who have made significant contributions to American music. However, the Pulitzer committee might consider works that are premiered in the U.S. or have a significant American presence.\n\nCheb Mami's music, while influential, is more associated with the Arab music scene. If he were to compose a work that is premiered in the U.S. and meets the Pulitzer's criteria, there's no inherent reason why he couldn't win. The Pulitzer is not limited to any specific ethnic or cultural background, but rather to the quality of the composition. However, the challenge might be in getting his work recognized by the Pulitzer committee, given the existing cultural context and the committee's focus on American music.\n\nBut the question is about impossibility.

      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for excellence in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often with a focus on American composers. However, the Pulitzer Prizes have expanded over time to include more diverse works, including those from international artists.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and composer known for his traditional and contemporary music. He's part of the Gnawa music tradition, which is a blend of African, Arab, and Mediterranean influences. His work often incorporates traditional instruments and rhythms. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The Pulitzer Prize for musical composition is open to any eligible work, regardless of the composer's nationality. \n2. The prize is awarded for original compositions, so if Cheb Mami has created a work that meets the criteria, he could be eligible. \n3. The Pulitzer Prizes have historically recognized a range of musical styles, though there might be a focus on Western classical music. However, there have been instances of non-traditional or world music being recognized. \n\nI should check if there are any restrictions on the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. From what I know, the Pulitzer Prizes are not limited to American composers. For example, in the past, there have been awards given to composers from other countries. However, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to an American composer, but wait\u2014no, that's not entirely accurate. Let me verify.\n\nActually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to works that are \"American\" in origin, but the composer can be from any country. However, the Pulitzer Prize for Music specifically requires that the work be composed by an American citizen. Wait, I need to check that. \n\nWait, according to the Pulitzer Prize website, the Music category is for a composition that is \"American in character\" and is composed by an American citizen. So the composer must be a U.S. citizen. If that's the case, then Cheb Mami, being Moroccan, would not be eligible unless he is a U.S. citizen. However, if he is not a U.S. citizen, then he can't win that specific prize. But the question is about whether it's impossible. \n\nSo, if the Pulitzer Prize for Music requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen, then Cheb Mami would not be eligible unless he is a citizen. However, if he is a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. But the question doesn't specify his citizenship. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the prize is open to non-American composers. I need to clarify this. \n\nLooking up the Pulitzer Prize for Music criteria: The Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composition that is \"American in character\" and is composed by an American citizen. So the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he cannot win this prize. \n\nBut the question is whether it's impossible for him to win. If he is a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. If he is not, then it's impossible. Since the question doesn't provide information about his citizenship, we have to assume that it's possible if he meets the criteria. However, the question is phrased as \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win...\" So the answer would depend on whether he meets the eligibility criteria. \n\nBut the question is asking if it's impossible, not whether he is eligible. So, if the Pulitzer Prize requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen, and if Cheb Mami is not, then it's impossible. However, if he is a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. Since the question doesn't specify, we can't assume his citizenship. Therefore, the answer would depend on that. \n\nBut the question is a yes/no question. So the answer would be \"No\" if there's a possibility that he could win, given that he meets the criteria. Since the question is phrased as \"Is it impossible\", the answer would be \"No\" (i.e., it's not impossible) if there's any possibility. \n\nAlternatively, if the Pulitzer Prize for Music is not restricted to U.S. citizens, then the answer would be \"No\" (it's not impossible). \n\nBut according to the official rules, the Pulitzer Prize for Music requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, then it's impossible. However, if he is, then it's possible. Since the question doesn't state his citizenship, we can't confirm, but the answer would be \"No\" (it's not impossible) if there's a possibility. \n\nWait, the question is asking \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win...\" So if there's any scenario where it's possible (e.g., if he is a U.S. citizen), then the answer would be \"No\" (it's not impossible). Therefore, the answer would be \"No\" unless there's a rule that explicitly makes it impossible regardless of citizenship. \n\nBut the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to an American composer, so if Cheb Mami is not an American citizen, then it's impossible. However, if he is, then possible. Since the question doesn't specify his citizenship, but the question is phrased as a general statement, the answer would be \"No\" (it's not impossible) because it's possible if he meets the criteria. Therefore, the answer would be {\"decision\": false}, meaning it's not impossible. \n\nWait, but the question is \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win...\" So the answer is \"No\" if there's a possibility. Therefore, the correct answer would be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall who Cheb Mami is. He's a Tunisian singer and songwriter, known for his work in the Arab world, especially with the band Diam's. Now, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition is awarded for original compositions in the United States.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize is given by the Pulitzer Board, which is based in the US. The prize is for works that are considered to be of high artistic merit. Cheb Mami's work is primarily in Arabic music, which might be considered as part of the broader musical composition category. However, the Pulitzer Prize typically recognizes works that are composed for American audiences or have a significant impact in the US. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize does have some flexibility. For example, they have awarded prizes for works that are in other languages, like the 2020 Pulitzer for Drama went to a play in English, but there have been cases where works from other countries were considered. However, the musical composition category is specific. The Pulitzer for Music is awarded for \"original compositions in the field of music,\" and it's given to a composer, not necessarily the performer. \n\nCheb Mami is a performer, not a composer. So even if his music were considered, the prize would go to the composer, not the performer. However, if he were to compose a piece that meets the Pulitzer criteria, then he could be eligible. But the question is about him winning the prize. So, if he were to compose a musical work that is recognized by the Pulitzer Board, then it's possible. However, the question is whether it's impossible. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"impossible.\" So, is there any reason why it's impossible? Well, the Pulitzer Prize is open to any eligible work, regardless of the composer's nationality or background, as long as the work meets the criteria. So, if Cheb Mami were to compose a piece that meets the Pulitzer's standards, then it's possible. Therefore, the answer would be no, it's not impossible. So the decision would be false. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to the composer, not the performer. So if Cheb Mami is a performer, unless he's also a composer, he wouldn't be eligible. But the question doesn't specify whether he's a composer or not. However, the user is asking about him winning the prize, so assuming he's a composer, then it's possible. But if he's not a composer, then it's not possible. But the question is phrased as a general question, not specific to his current status. \n\nSo, the answer would be that it's not impossible, hence the decision is false. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original compositions for the stage, such as operas, musicals, or other theatrical works.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genre of Ra\u00ef music. He's been active since the late 1980s and has gained international recognition. However, his work is primarily in Arabic and has been more associated with the North African music scene rather than the Western classical or Broadway musical traditions that the Pulitzer Prize often recognizes.\n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize does consider a broad range of musical works. For example, in the past, they've awarded prizes for works that might not be traditionally Western. However, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is typically given to American composers. The Pulitzer Prizes are administered by Columbia University, and the awards are usually given to works that are produced in the United States. However, the criteria might allow for international works if they meet certain conditions, like being composed by an American citizen or being produced in the U.S.\n\nCheb Mami is a Moroccan citizen, so unless he has American citizenship or the work is produced in the U.S., it might be challenging. However, the Pulitzer Prize has occasionally recognized works by non-American composers, especially if they are American citizens or if the work is produced in the U.S. For example, there have been cases where composers from other countries have won if they meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nBut the question is about whether it's impossible. If there's any possibility that Cheb Mami could meet the criteria, then the answer would be no. However, if the criteria are strictly limited to American composers, then it's impossible. The Pulitzer Prize's official guidelines state that the work must be composed by an American citizen. So if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he wouldn't be eligible. However, he might have dual citizenship or have been naturalized. If he hasn't, then it's impossible.\n\nBut I don't have current information on Cheb Mami's citizenship status. However, given that he's a Moroccan artist, it's possible he's not a U.S. citizen. Therefore, unless he has the necessary citizenship, he wouldn't be eligible. Therefore, the answer would be yes, it's impossible. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"impossible\" in general, not considering any hypothetical scenarios. So if there's a possibility that he could win under certain conditions, then the answer would be no. But if the criteria are such that he can't meet them, then the answer is yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about whether it's impossible based on the nature of his work. For example, if his music is not in the style that the Pulitzer Prize typically recognizes. But the Pulitzer does consider a variety of musical forms, including contemporary works. So if he composed a musical or opera that fits the criteria, even if it's in Arabic, it's possible. However, the Pulitzer Prize is based on U.S. citizenship and production, so if he's not a U.S. citizen, it's impossible.\n\nSo, based on the information available, the answer would be that it's impossible if he's not a U.S. citizen. Therefore, the answer is yes, it's impossible. But if there's a possibility he could become a U.S. citizen and compose a qualifying work, then it's not impossible. However, the question is about whether it's impossible, not whether it's possible. The answer depends on the current status and eligibility criteria. Since the user is asking for a yes/no answer, and given that Cheb Mami is Moroccan and likely not a U.S. citizen, the answer would be yes, it's impossible. But I need to make sure I'm not making assumptions. The question is whether it's impossible, not whether it's likely. So if there's any scenario where it's possible, the answer is no. However, the Pulitzer Prize's eligibility criteria might make it impossible unless he meets certain conditions. Therefore, the answer would be no, it's not impossible, because it's possible if he meets the criteria. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win...\", so if there's any possibility, then the answer is no. However, without knowing his citizenship, maybe the answer is no. But I think the answer is no because it's possible if he meets the criteria. Therefore, the correct answer is {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original compositions for stage or screen, often by American composers.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and composer known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's been recognized with awards like the Victoire d'Or and has been part of the group Cheb Khaled. However, the Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the United States. The eligibility criteria for the Pulitzer Prize in music usually require the work to be composed by an American citizen, though I'm not entirely sure if that's a strict requirement. Also, the Pulitzer Prize often focuses on works that are considered significant contributions to American culture or music.\n\nSo, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he might not be eligible for the Pulitzer Prize. However, the question is about whether it's impossible for him to win. If there's any possibility, even if he's not a U.S. citizen, perhaps through a different category or if the rules change, then the answer would be no. But traditionally, the Pulitzer Prize for music is open to American composers. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not an American citizen, he wouldn't be eligible. However, the question is phrased as \"impossible,\" which might depend on current rules. I need to check if the Pulitzer Prize allows non-Americans to win. \n\nUpon checking, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to an American composer. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he would not be eligible. However, the question is about whether it's impossible. If there's a possibility that he could become a U.S. citizen or if the rules change, then it's possible. But given the current rules, it's impossible. Therefore, the answer would be yes, it's impossible. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win...\" So if he's not eligible due to citizenship, then the answer would be yes, it's impossible. However, if there's a way for him to qualify, then it's not impossible. Since the current rules require the composer to be American, and assuming Cheb Mami is not, then the answer is yes. However, I need to confirm if the Pulitzer Prize allows non-Americans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize allows works by non-Americans as long as they are composed in the U.S. or have a significant American connection. But I think the standard is that the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he can't win. Therefore, the answer would be yes, it's impossible. But I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Pulitzer Prize for Music is open to composers of any nationality. But I think that's not the case. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to an American composer. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not an American citizen, he cannot win. Therefore, the answer is yes, it's impossible. However, if there's a possibility that he could become a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. But the question is about whether it's impossible now. Since the current status of his citizenship is not specified, but assuming he is not a U.S. citizen, then the answer would be yes. But the question is phrased as a general question, not about current circumstances. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize allows for non-Americans. For example, some other Pulitzer categories allow non-Americans. But the music category is specific. I think the answer is that it's impossible because the Pulitzer Prize for Music requires the composer to be an American citizen. Therefore, unless Cheb Mami is a U.S. citizen, he can't win. Since the question doesn't specify his citizenship, but given that he's a Moroccan artist, it's likely he's not a U.S. citizen. Therefore, the answer is yes, it's impossible. So the JSON would be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me start by recalling what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often in the form of operas, symphonies, or other significant compositions.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a musician known for his work in the Arab world, particularly as a singer and composer. He's associated with the Andalusian music style, which has roots in Islamic Spain and incorporates elements from Arabic, Berber, and Andalusian traditions. His work is more in the realm of traditional and folk music rather than Western classical or contemporary classical music, which are the usual categories for Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nHowever, the Pulitzer Prize is not limited to Western classical music. While the majority of Pulitzer winners in the music category are in classical or contemporary classical genres, there might be exceptions. For example, there have been instances where works from different musical traditions have been recognized, especially if they are considered significant and innovative. However, the Pulitzer Prize has a history of recognizing works that are in the Western classical tradition, and the selection process might be biased towards that.\n\nBut the question is about whether it's impossible. So, is there any reason why Cheb Mami couldn't win? Well, the Pulitzer Prize is open to any eligible work, regardless of the musical tradition, as long as it meets the criteria. However, the selection process involves a jury that may have biases or preferences towards certain styles. But \"impossible\" would mean that there's a definitive reason it can't happen. Since the Pulitzer has awarded prizes to a variety of musical forms, including some non-Western styles, it's not impossible. However, it's also possible that the jury might not consider his work eligible or might not recognize it as fitting the criteria. But the question is about impossibility, not likelihood. Since there's no inherent reason why a work from Cheb Mami's tradition couldn't be eligible, the answer would be no, it's not impossible. Therefore, the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall who Cheb Mami is. He's a Tunisian singer and composer known for his work in the Arab world, particularly with the band Dinar. Now, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition is awarded for original compositions in the United States. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize is given by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the U.S., and the award is for musical compositions. Cheb Mami's work is primarily in Arabic music, which might be considered different from the Western classical or contemporary music that the Pulitzer typically recognizes. However, the Pulitzer does have a category for music, which includes compositions in various genres, not just classical. For example, in the past, there have been winners in contemporary classical music, and perhaps even other genres if they meet the criteria.\n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, and the work must be in the United States. However, the composer can be of any nationality. So, if Cheb Mami composed a piece that meets the Pulitzer's criteria, he could be eligible. However, the question is about impossibility. Is there any reason why he couldn't win?\n\nThe main challenges might be cultural or genre-related. The Pulitzer often favors Western classical music, but there have been exceptions. For instance, in 2022, the Pulitzer for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work, which is contemporary classical. But there's no rule that says only Western classical music is eligible. If Cheb Mami's composition is considered a significant work in the field of music, even if it's in a different style, it might be eligible. \n\nAnother angle: the Pulitzer Prize is awarded to U.S. citizens. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded to individuals regardless of nationality, as long as the work is eligible. For example, the prize can be awarded to non-U.S. citizens if the work is considered part of the American music scene. However, the composer's nationality might affect eligibility. Wait, no, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to the composer, and the composer can be any nationality. For example, in 2021, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Missy Mazzoli, an American composer, but there have been instances where non-American composers have won, though I can't recall specific examples. \n\nWait, actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, and the work must be composed in the United States. Wait, no, the work doesn't have to be composed in the U.S., but the composer must be a U.S. citizen? Or is that not a requirement? Let me check. \n\nAccording to the Pulitzer Prize website, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition. The composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, that's not accurate. The Pulitzer Prize is given to individuals who are U.S. citizens. So, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he wouldn't be eligible. However, the question is whether it's impossible for him to win. If he is not a U.S. citizen, then he can't win the Pulitzer Prize for Music. But if he is a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. \n\nWait, but Cheb Mami is Tunisian, so he's not a U.S. citizen. Unless he has dual citizenship. But the question doesn't specify. Assuming he's not a U.S. citizen, then he can't be eligible for the Pulitzer Prize. However, if he were a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. But the question is about impossibility. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether Cheb Mami is a U.S. citizen. If he isn't, then it's impossible. But if he is, then it's possible. Since the question doesn't provide information about his citizenship, perhaps the answer is that it's possible, but not certain. However, the question is asking whether it's impossible. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win...\" So, if there's any possibility that he could win, the answer is no. If it's impossible regardless of circumstances, then yes. \n\nSince Cheb Mami is Tunisian, and the Pulitzer requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen (or perhaps not?), but if the Pulitzer allows non-U.S. citizens, then it's possible. But I'm not sure. Let me check the actual criteria. \n\nLooking up the Pulitzer Prize for Music: According to the Pulitzer Prize website, the award is given to a composer for an original composition. The composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, that's not stated. Let me check. \n\nActually, the Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals who are citizens of the United States. So, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he cannot be awarded a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, if he is not a U.S. citizen, then it's impossible for him to win. However, the question is whether it's impossible. If there's a possibility that he could become a U.S. citizen, then it's not impossible. \n\nBut the question is about the current situation. Since the user hasn't provided information about Cheb Mami's citizenship, but given that he is Tunisian, it's likely that he's not a U.S. citizen. Therefore, under the current circumstances, it's impossible. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize might have different rules. For example, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer, and the composer can be of any nationality as long as the composition is in the U.S. or meets certain criteria. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize for Music is open to any composer, regardless of nationality. For example, in the past, have non-U.S. composers won? I can't recall any. The Pulitzer Prizes are typically awarded to U.S. citizens. So, if that's the case, then Cheb Mami, being Tunisian, cannot win the Pulitzer Prize. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be yes, it's impossible. But wait, maybe the Pulitzer Prize allows for non-U.S. citizens. For example, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to a non-U.S. citizen in the past? \n\nWait, I'm not certain. Let me think. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals who are citizens of the United States. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he cannot win the Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, the answer would be yes, it's impossible. \n\nBut the question is whether it's impossible. If there's a possibility that he could become a U.S. citizen, then it's not impossible. However, the question is in the present tense. Unless the user has more information, but the user hasn't provided it. \n\nIn the absence of information about Cheb Mami's citizenship, but given that he is Tunisian, the answer would be that it's impossible. Therefore, the answer is {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition?\" The user wants a yes/no answer in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Cheb Mami is. From what I know, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan musician known for his work in the Arab music scene, blending traditional and modern styles. He's been active in the music industry, so he's likely a composer and performer.\n\nNext, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including music. The prize is given to a composer for an original work that has been performed in the United States. The criteria include the work being a composition for orchestra, chorus, or solo instrument, and it must be premiered in the U.S. within the past year.\n\nNow, the key here is whether Cheb Mami's work meets the criteria for the Pulitzer. Since he's a Moroccan artist, his work might not have been premiered in the U.S. unless he has collaborated with American ensembles or had his work performed there. But the Pulitzer does consider works by international composers if they meet the performance criteria. However, the prize is typically awarded to American composers, though there have been exceptions.\n\nWait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is open to composers of any nationality, as long as the work meets the criteria. For example, in the past, there have been non-American composers who have won the prize. However, the work must be performed in the U.S. So if Cheb Mami has a composition that was premiered in the U.S., he could be eligible. But if his work hasn't been performed there, then he wouldn't be eligible.\n\nBut the question is about whether it's impossible. So the answer depends on whether there's any possibility that Cheb Mami could meet the criteria. If there's a possibility, then the answer is no; if it's impossible, then yes.\n\nCheb Mami's music is primarily in the Arab world. Has he had any works performed in the U.S.? I'm not sure. If he hasn't, then he wouldn't be eligible. But if he has, then it's possible. Since the question is about possibility, not current status, the answer hinges on whether it's possible for him to meet the criteria in the future.\n\nThe Pulitzer is awarded annually, so if Cheb Mami composes a piece that is premiered in the U.S. and meets the other criteria, he could be considered. Therefore, it's not impossible. Hence, the answer would be \"no,\" meaning it's not impossible. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievement in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes works that are original and of high artistic merit.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and composer known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's been active in the music industry for several decades. To win a Pulitzer Prize, his work would need to meet the high standards set by the Pulitzer committee. The Pulitzer Prize is not limited to any particular genre or cultural origin, so theoretically, any eligible work could be considered.\n\nHowever, there are a few factors to consider. The Pulitzer Prize for music is usually awarded for works that are composed for performance, often in the Western classical tradition. Cheb Mami's music is rooted in traditional Arabic music, which might be different from the Western classical style that the Pulitzer often recognizes. But the Pulitzer has expanded its scope over time to include a broader range of musical styles, so it's not impossible.\n\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Board, which evaluates the work based on its merit. If Cheb Mami's compositions are considered to be of high quality and meet the criteria, there's no reason why he couldn't win. There's no rule that restricts the Pulitzer to only certain types of music or artists. Therefore, it's not impossible, but rather a matter of whether his work meets the specific criteria and is recognized by the committee.\n\nSo the answer would be no, it's not impossible. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often for the stage, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. The prize is given to a single composer each year, and the work must be a musical composition that has been performed publicly.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genre of ra\u00ef. He's been active since the 1980s and has gained international recognition. However, he's not a U.S. citizen. The Pulitzer Prize requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen, as per the rules set by the Pulitzer Prize Board. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a way around that? Let me check. The Pulitzer Prizes are administered by Columbia University, and the rules state that the winner must be a citizen of the United States. So even if someone is a citizen of another country, like Morocco, they wouldn't be eligible unless they are also a U.S. citizen. \n\nCheb Mami's music is primarily in Arabic, and his works are more associated with the Arab music scene. The Pulitzer Prize for music usually looks for works that are in the Western classical tradition or American popular music. However, the prize is open to any nationality as long as the composer is a U.S. citizen. \n\nBut since Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he wouldn't be eligible regardless of the quality of his work. Therefore, it's impossible for him to win the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition because he doesn't meet the citizenship requirement. \n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any exception or if the rules have changed. From what I know, the Pulitzer Prize for Music has been awarded to composers like George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, and more recently, others, all of whom were U.S. citizens. There's no indication that the rules have been relaxed to include non-U.S. citizens. \n\nSo, based on the current eligibility criteria, the answer would be yes, it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition because he is not a U.S. citizen. Therefore, the decision should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition.

The musical composition category typically recognizes original works of music, such as operas, symphonies, or other significant compositions. The prize is given to individuals or groups, so it's possible for a composer to win if their work meets the criteria.\n\nNow, who is Cheb Mami? From what I know, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and composer known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's been recognized for his contributions to music, especially in the North African region. However, I'm not sure about his specific works or whether he has been nominated or won any major awards.\n\nThe key here is whether it's impossible for him to win a Pulitzer. The Pulitzer Prize is not limited to any particular region or ethnicity, so theoretically, any qualified composer could win. However, the Pulitzer is a prestigious award, and the selection process is rigorous. Cheb Mami's work might not be in the style that the Pulitzer committee typically recognizes. For example, the Pulitzer for music has historically been awarded to composers in the Western classical tradition, though there have been exceptions. However, the criteria for the prize include originality, artistic merit, and significance.\n\nIf Cheb Mami's compositions are considered original and of high artistic merit, and if they fit within the scope of the Pulitzer's criteria, then it's possible he could win. However, if his work is not in the traditional Western classical genre, it might be less likely. But the Pulitzer has expanded over time to include a broader range of musical styles. For example, in the past, there have been awards for works that incorporate elements of different musical traditions.\n\nSo, is it impossible? Well, \"impossible\" is a strong term. Unless there are specific restrictions, like the Pulitzer only being awarded to American citizens, but I don't think that's the case. The Pulitzer is open to works created in the United States, but the composer doesn't necessarily have to be American. Wait, actually, the Pulitzer Prize is awarded for works that are produced in the United States, but the composer can be from anywhere. However, the award is given to the composer, so if Cheb Mami is a Moroccan citizen, but his work is considered American, perhaps? Or does the Pulitzer require the work to be composed in the US or have a US connection?\n\nThis is a bit unclear. If Cheb Mami's work is not associated with the US, then he might not be eligible. However, the Pulitzer has had international recognition in some cases. For example, the Pulitzer Prize for Music has been awarded to composers from outside the US, such as in the case of some contemporary composers. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, the Pulitzer might require the work to be composed in the US. If that's the case, then if Cheb Mami's compositions are not composed in the US, he might not be eligible. However, if his work is composed in the US, then he could be eligible.\n\nBut the question is whether it's impossible. If there's a possibility that his work meets the criteria and is eligible, then the answer would be no, it's not impossible. However, if there are strict criteria that make it impossible, then yes. Since I don't have specific information about Cheb Mami's eligibility, but the question is about impossibility. The answer would depend on whether there's any possibility. Since the question is phrased as \"impossible\", the answer would be \"no\" if there's a possibility, and \"yes\" if it's certain that it can't happen.\n\nGiven that the Pulitzer Prize is awarded for musical compositions and there's no explicit restriction on the composer's nationality or the origin of the work (as long as the work is eligible), it's possible that Cheb Mami could win if his work meets the criteria.

He's been recognized for his contributions to music, such as the Grammy Award he won in 2012 for Best Traditional World Music Album. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize for music is open to any composer, regardless of their background or origin. The prize is not restricted to any particular genre or nationality. Since Cheb Mami is a composer who has already received international recognition, it's theoretically possible for him to be considered for a Pulitzer Prize. \n\nHowever, I should check if there are any restrictions. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded by the Pulitzer Board, which is part of Columbia University. The criteria for the music category typically require the work to be of high artistic quality and to be composed for performance. Cheb Mami's compositions, if they meet these criteria, could be eligible. \n\nBut wait, there's a catch. The Pulitzer Prize for music is awarded to a single person, and the prize is given for a specific composition. Cheb Mami's work is in the traditional world music genre. While the Pulitzer has previously awarded prizes to composers in various genres, including classical and contemporary, the question is whether his work would be eligible. \n\nAlso, the Pulitzer Prize for music has been awarded to composers like George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, and others. However, the prize is not limited to Western classical music. For example, in 2021, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work \"Partita for 8 Voices.\" \n\nBut there's no explicit restriction on the genre or the composer's origin. Therefore, if Cheb Mami's work meets the criteria of the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition, it's possible for him to win. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether it's impossible. Since there's no inherent impossibility based on his background, the answer would be no. Therefore, the correct answer is that it's not impossible, so the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}"

      "<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall who Cheb Mami is. He's a Tunisian musician known for his work in the Arab music scene, right? He's been active since the 1980s and has a following in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nNow, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including music. The prize is given to individuals or organizations for distinguished achievements in the arts, including music. The criteria for the music category typically involve the composition being a significant work that has been performed publicly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is there any reason why Cheb Mami couldn't win? Well, the Pulitzer is open to anyone, regardless of their origin, as long as they meet the criteria. The prize is not limited to American citizens, though the Pulitzer Foundation is based in the United States. However, the Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded to non-Americans in the past, especially in categories like music, literature, and journalism. For example, the Pulitzer for Music has been awarded to composers from various countries.\n\nCheb Mami's work is in traditional Arabic music, which might be considered in the context of the Pulitzer's criteria. However, the Pulitzer typically looks for works that are either American or have a significant impact on American culture. Wait, but the Pulitzer for Music is awarded for works that are \"distinguished\" and \"publicly performed.\" So if Cheb Mami's compositions are publicly performed and considered distinguished, he could be eligible.\n\nBut there's another angle. The Pulitzer Prize is administered by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the US. However, the board has considered works from around the world. For example, the 2016 Pulitzer for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw, an American composer, but there have been \n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often in the form of operas, choral music, or other significant compositions.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan-French singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's been active in the music industry and has released several albums. However, I'm not sure about his specific contributions to classical or traditional Western musical compositions that might qualify for a Pulitzer. The Pulitzer Prize usually focuses on works that are considered to have high artistic merit and are within the traditional categories they've established. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize does have some flexibility. For example, they have awarded prizes for musical composition in the past, such as to composers like John Cage and Aaron Copland. However, these are typically for works that are more in the realm of classical or contemporary classical music. Cheb Mami's music is more pop and traditional Arabic, which might not fit into the categories that the Pulitzer typically recognizes. \n\nHowever, the question is about possibility, not probability. So even if it's unlikely, is it impossible? The Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which has the discretion to consider various types of work.

First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition prize is given for distinguished musical composition by an American that has had its first performance in the U.S. within the year.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is an Algerian singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genre of ra\u00ef music. He has gained international recognition, especially after his performance at the 2009 Grammy Awards. However, his work is primarily rooted in Arabic music, which is different from Western classical or contemporary American music.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has specific criteria. The composer must be American, and the work must have its first performance in the U.S. So, if Cheb Mami is not an American citizen, he wouldn't be eligible. But wait, does the Pulitzer consider dual citizenship or residency? I think the prize is awarded to U.S. citizens, but maybe there are exceptions. However, even if he were eligible, his music is traditionally from the Arab world, which might not fit the criteria of \"American\" music. \n\nWait, the Pulitzer for music can be given to works that are American in origin. But Cheb Mami's compositions are not American. So even if he were eligible, the work itself would need to be American.

Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Cheb Mami is. From what I remember, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan musician known for his work in the ra\u00ef genre, which is a traditional music style from Algeria. He's been active in the music scene for a while, and I think he's been recognized internationally. \n\nNext, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including music. The music category typically goes to a composer for an original composition, which could be a symphony, opera, or other forms. The prize is given by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is part of Columbia University. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether Cheb Mami has been recognized in this category. I know that the Pulitzer Prize is highly prestigious, and it's usually awarded to American composers, but there have been cases where non-Americans have won. For example, George Gershwin was American but his works were influential. However, I'm not sure if any non-American composers have won the Pulitzer for musical composition. \n\nWait, actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for a work that has been performed in the U.S. and is considered to be of high artistic quality. The composer doesn't necessarily have to be American, but the work must be performed in the U.S. So if Cheb Mami's work has been performed in the U.S. and meets the criteria, he could be eligible. \n\nI don't recall any specific information about Cheb Mami winning\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

The Pulitzer Prize for music is usually given to Western classical composers. However, in recent years, there has been a broader recognition of diverse musical forms. For example, in 2021, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work \"Partita for 8 Voices,\" which is a contemporary classical piece. \n\nBut Cheb Mami's music is more rooted in traditional Arabic music, which might not fit the traditional criteria for the Pulitzer Prize. However, the Pulitzer Board has shown openness to different genres. For instance, in 2016, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Kendrick Lamar for his album \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" which is a hip-hop album. That was a significant moment as it was the first time a hip-hop album won the prize. \n\nSo, the question is whether Cheb Mami's work could be considered eligible.

He's been active since the 1990s and has released several albums. His style blends traditional Arabic music with contemporary elements, and he's been recognized in various international music festivals and awards.\n\nThe key points here are: Can someone from Morocco, specifically Cheb Mami, win a Pulitzer Prize in musical composition? Well, the Pulitzer Prize is open to anyone, regardless of nationality, as long as the work meets the criteria. The prize is not restricted to U.S. citizens or residents. For example, past winners have included composers from various countries, such as Igor Stravinsky (though he was born in Russia, he was a citizen of the U.S. for a period), and more recently, composers from other countries have been recognized.\n\nHowever, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded for works that are \"original compositions for solo voice and orchestra, or for chorus and orchestra, or for solo voice and piano, or for chorus and piano, or for solo instrument and piano, or for ensemble and piano, or for solo instrument and orchestra, or for ensemble and orchestra.\" The work must be composed and performed in the United States, or it must be a work that has been performed in the U.S. and is considered part of the American music scene.

Let me start by recalling what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes works that are original compositions for a musical, often with a libretto, and they are usually presented by American composers.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a name that I associate with a Moroccan musician. I think he's known for his work in traditional and contemporary music, perhaps blending different genres. But I need to confirm his background. Let me check: Cheb Mami, also known as Cheb Khaled, is a Moroccan singer and musician, known for his contributions to Arabic music and world music. He's been active since the late 1980s and has a significant following in the Arab world and beyond.\n\nThe key point here is whether he qualifies for the Pulitzer Prize. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to American citizens, I believe. The Pulitzer Prize Board requires that the work be \"originally written, composed, or produced in the United States.\" So if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he might not be eligible. However, there's also the possibility that the Pulitzer Prize could be awarded to a non-American if the work is considered to have been produced in the U.S. or if there's some exception. But I think the general rule is that the author or creator must be a U.S. citizen or resident.\n\nCheb Mami is Moroccan, so unless he has U.S. citizenship or is a resident, he might not be eligible. However, there might be cases where the work itself is considered to be American, but in this case, his music is more associated with Moroccan culture and Arabic music. Therefore, it's unlikely that his work would be considered as having been produced in the U.S. or by a U.S. citizen.\n\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer, so if Cheb Mami is primarily known as a singer rather than a composer, that could be another barrier. However, some musicians do compose their own music, so that's possible. But even if he did compo\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes works that are original compositions for a musical, opera, or other forms of musical theater.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan musician known for his work in traditional and contemporary music, blending Arab and Western styles. He's been recognized with awards like the World Music Award and has a following in the music scene. However, the Pulitzer Prize is a U.S.-based award, and it's not clear if Cheb Mami has been active in the U.S. music scene or if his work would be considered eligible for such an award. \n\nBut the key here is whether it's \"impossible\" for him to win. The question is about possibility, not current likelihood. The Pulitzer Prize is open to any eligible work, regardless of the artist's origin. So, if Cheb Mami were to compose a musical work that meets the Pulitzer's criteria, such as being an original composition for a musical or opera, and if it were submitted and judged by the Pulitzer committee, it's theoretically possible for him to win. \n\nHowever, there might be practical challenges. For example, the Pulitzer Prize is administered by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which might have specific criteria or preferences. Also, the award is typically given to works that are produced in the United States. If Cheb Mami's work is not produced in the U.S.\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for excellence in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often for stage or concert music.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Tunisian singer and composer known for his work in the Arab music scene. He's been involved in various musical projects and has a following in the Middle East and North Africa. However, I'm not sure about his specific works in the context of Western classical or contemporary musical compositions that might be eligible for a Pulitzer. \n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has certain criteria. For example, the musical composition prize is usually given to works that are premiered in the United States and meet specific standards of artistic merit. Cheb Mami's music might be more aligned with traditional or popular Arab music rather than the Western classical or contemporary genres that are typically recognized by the Pulitzer. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer does consider a range of musical forms. For instance, in the past, there have been winners in the musical category who are not necessarily from the Western classical tradition. However, the Pulitzer's criteria might still require the work to be in English or have a significant presence in the U.S. market. \n\nAnother angle: the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, which could include works for orchestra, chorus, or other ensembles. If Cheb Mami has composed work\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know who Cheb Mami is. From what I recall, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab music scene, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. He's part of the Rai music genre, which is a blend of traditional Arab music with modern elements. His work is more in the realm of popular music rather than classical or traditional Western music.\n\nNow, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including Music. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is given to a composer for an original composition, typically in the classical or traditional Western music genres. The criteria for this prize usually involve the work being a composition for orchestra, chorus, solo instrument, or other traditional forms. The Pulitzer committee looks for works that demonstrate originality, technical skill, and artistic merit within the Western classical tradition.\n\nSo, Cheb Mami's music is more in the Arab music tradition, which is different from the Western classical tradition that the Pulitzer Prize for Music typically recognizes. However, the Pulitzer Prizes have sometimes recognized works from diverse backgrounds, but I'm not sure if they've ever awarded a prize for non-Western classical music. For example, there was a case where a work by a non-Western composer was considered, but I don't recall any specific instances of a Moroccan artist winning the Pulitzer in that category.\n\nBut the key here is whether it's \"impossible.\" The question is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win. The answer would depend on whether the Pulitzer Prize's criteria are strictly limited to Western classical music. If the Pulitzer Prize is open to any form of musical composition, regardless of cultural origin, then it's possible. However, if the prize is strictly for Western classical compositions, then it's not possible.\n\nI should check the official Pulitzer Prize guidelines. According to the Pulitzer Prize website, the Music category is for \"original compositions for solo voice, chorus, orchestra, or other ensembles, or for a musical theater work.\" The examples given include works by composers like Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, and others in the Western classical and musical theater traditions. There's no explicit mention of non-Western genres, but the selection process is based on the work's quality and adherence to traditional compositional techniques. However, the Pulitzer has sometimes recognized works from diverse backgrounds, but it's more common to see Western classical works.\n\nCheb Mami's music, while influential in the Arab world, is not typically categorized under Western classical music. Therefore, it's unlikely that his work would be considered for the Pulitzer Prize for Music. However, the question is whether it's impossible. If there's any possibility that the Pulitzer could recognize a non-Western work, then the answer would be no. But if the prize is strictly limited to Western classical music, then the answer would be yes.\n\nAnother angle: the Pulitzer Prize is not limited to any specific cultural origin. The award is given based on the merit of the work, regardless of the composer's background. However, the genre and style might still need to align with the prize's expectations. If Cheb Mami's work were to be considered, it would need to fit within the criteria of the prize. For example, if he composed a piece in a style that could be considered part of the broader musical composition category, perhaps in a more contemporary or cross-genre form, there might be a chance.

The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievements in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often in the form of operas, choral music, or other significant compositions.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer known for his traditional music, particularly the \"Cheb\" style, which is a blend of Arabic and Western music. He's been active since the 1970s and has a following in the Arab world. However, his work is more associated with popular and traditional music rather than the classical or contemporary forms that might be considered for a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has specific criteria. For instance, the prize is usually given to works that are considered to be of high artistic merit and have been premiered or published within a certain timeframe. The selection process involves a jury of experts in the field. So, the question is whether Cheb Mami's work would meet these criteria.\n\nBut wait, the question is about impossibility. Is there any reason that would make it impossible for him to win? Well, the Pulitzer Prize is not limited to any particular nationality or region, so in theory, any eligible work could be considered. However, the prize is often given to works in English or American contexts, though there have been exceptions. For example, Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded to international composers in the past, but it's not common.\n\nCheb Mami's music is primarily in Arabic and may not be in English. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is typically for works that are composed for orchestra, chorus, or soloists, and might be in English. However, the Pulitzer has expanded its scope over time. For example, in 2020, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work \"Partita for 8 Voices,\" which is in English. However, there's no explicit rule that the work must be in English. \n\nBut even if the work is in another language, the Pulitzer could still consider it if it's deemed to have significant artistic merit. However, the prize is often associated with American music, so there might be a bias towards works that are more aligned with the American musical tradition. \n\nHowever, the question is about impossibility. If there's any possibility, then the answer would be \"no,\" it's not impossible.

He's been recognized with awards like the World Music Awards and has a following in the Arab world. However, the Pulitzer Prize is a U.S.-based award, and while it's open to international entries, there might be specific criteria. For instance, the Pulitzer for music requires the work to be composed for performance in the United States, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, actually, the Pulitzer Prize doesn't require the composer to be a U.S. citizen, but the work must be composed for performance in the U.S. or in a U.S. venue. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact eligibility rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize for music is awarded to a U.S. citizen. Let me check that. From what I remember, the Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals who are U.S. citizens. So if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he might not be eligible. But I should confirm that. Let me think: the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. If that's the case, then if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he can't win. But if the rules have changed, or if the Pulitzer allows non-citizens, then it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize doesn't require the composer to be a U.S. citizen, but the work must be composed in the U.S. or have a U.S. connection. However, I'm not certain. Another angle: Cheb Mami's music is primarily in Arabic, and the Pulitzer Prizes might not typically award prizes for non-English works. But the Pulitzer does consider works in other languages, like the 2021 Pulitzer for Music went to a work in English, but there have been other languages. However, the Pulitzer for Music is usually for works that are performed in the U.S., so if Cheb Mami's music is performed there, maybe it's possible.\n\nBut the key point is whether the Pulitzer Prize is open to non-U.S. citizens. If the Pulitzer requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen, then Cheb Mami, being Tunisian, wouldn't be eligible. However, if the award allows non-citizens, then it's possible. I need to check the eligibility criteria for the Pulitzer Prize for Music. From what I recall, the Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals who are U.S. citizens, so if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he would be ineligible. However, if he's a naturalized citizen, then he might be eligible. But the question doesn't specify his citizenship status. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Pulitzer Prize allows for non-citizens. For example, some other awards have non-citizens as winners. But I'm not certain about the Pulitzer's specific rules. Another possibility is that the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a work, not necessarily the composer's nationality. For example, if the work is composed in the U.S., even if the composer is not a citizen. However, the Pulitzer's official website states that the prizes are awarded to individuals who are U.S. citizens. Therefore, if Cheb\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

      "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition category is typically for original works of music, such as operas, symphonies, or other significant compositions.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genres of ra\u00ef and pop. He's been active since the 1990s and has gained international recognition. However, his work is primarily in Arabic music, which might be a factor here. \n\nThe Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the United States. The criteria for the award usually require that the work be composed in the United States, or at least that the composer is a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, actually, the Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals regardless of nationality, but the work must be considered for the prize. However, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is typically for compositions that are premiered in the United States. \n\nBut I need to check if there are any restrictions. For example, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for a work that is considered to be of the highest quality. The work must be composed for a musical ensemble, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, the composer doesn't have to be a U.S. citizen. Wait, actually, the Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals who are citizens of the United States. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals regardless of nationality, but the work must be composed in the United States. Or is that not the case?\n\nWait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded for an original composition in the field of music. The work must be composed for a musical ensemble, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think. For example, past winners include composers from various countries, but the Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the United States. However, the rules might allow for international composers. \n\nBut maybe there's a requirement that the work be composed in the United States. For example, the Pulitzer Prize for Music requires that the work be composed for a musical ensemble and that it has been premiered in the United States. If that's the case, then Cheb Mami's compositions, which are in Arabic music and may not have been premiered in the U.S., might not qualify. \n\nAlternatively, if the Pulitzer Prize allows for works composed outside the U.S., then it's possible. However, the Pulitzer Prizes are typically awarded to works that are considered to be of the highest quality and that have been premiered in the U.S. So, if Cheb Mami's work hasn't been premiered in the U.S., then he might not be eligible. \n\nBut the question is whether it's impossible for him to win. If there's no absolute restriction, then it's possible. However, the question is about impossibility. If there are no rules that make it impossible, then the answer would be \"no,\" it's not impossible. \n\nBut perhaps the Pulitzer Prize for Music is only given to works that are in the Western classical tradition, and Cheb Mami's work is in a different genre, like pop or ra\u00ef, which might not be considered eligible. However, the Pulitzer Prize has expanded its scope over time. For example, in 2023, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to a work that was a pop album. Wait, no, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is typically for classical music. Wait, but in 2023, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to a work that was a pop album.

The work must be composed for a musical ensemble, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, the composer doesn't need to be a U.S. citizen.

      "<think>\n\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition prize is given to a composer for a musical work that has been produced in the United States. The work must be original and have been composed for performance, typically in a public concert or other public performance setting.\n\nNow, who is Cheb Mami? Cheb Mami is a Moroccan-born French rapper, singer, and songwriter. He's known for his work in the hip-hop and Arabic music scenes. His style blends traditional Arabic music with contemporary genres like hip-hop and electronic music. He's been active since the early 2000s and has gained international recognition.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition requires the work to be produced in the U.S., and the composer must be eligible. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded to individuals, not groups, but the work itself can be a collaboration. However, the composer is typically the person who wrote the music, so if Cheb Mami composed a musical work that was produced in the U.S., he could be eligible.\n\nBut wait, the question is about whether it's impossible. So, is there any reason why Cheb Mami couldn't win? Let's think about the criteria. The Pulitzer Prize for music is given to a composer for a musical work that has been produced in the United States. Cheb Mami is a French citizen, but he's lived in France and Morocco. However, the Pulitzer Prize doesn't restrict eligibility based on nationality; it's based on the work being produced in the U.S. So, if he composed a work that was produced in the U.S., he could be eligible. \n\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Prize has no age restrictions, so as long as he meets the other criteria, there's no age barrier. The only requirement is that the work is original and produced in the U.S. Therefore, it's not impossible for him to win if he meets those conditions. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle. The Pulitzer Prize for music is awarded to a composer, not necessarily\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition?\" The user wants a yes/no answer in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Cheb Mami is. From what I recall, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and musician known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genre of ra\u00ef music. He's been active since the 1990s and has gained international recognition. \n\nNext, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including Music. The Music category is for American composers, typically for compositions that are deemed to have \"the highest standards of artistic excellence.\" The Pulitzer Prize for Music is usually given to a single work, often an orchestral piece, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. \n\nNow, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize for Music is specific to American composers. Cheb Mami is Moroccan, so he's not an American citizen. However, I should check if there are any exceptions or if the Pulitzer has ever awarded to non-Americans. From what I know, the Pulitzer Prizes are generally awarded to individuals based in the United States. There have been instances where non-Americans have won other Pulitzer categories, like the Drama or Fiction, but the Music category is more restrictive. \n\nWait, but the Pulitzer Prize for Music is given to a composition, not necessarily the nationality of the composer. However, the Pulitzer organization typically requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen. For example, past winners like John Adams, Aaron Copland, and others are American. There's no record of a non-American winning the Pulitzer Prize for Music. \n\nBut wait, could there be a scenario where a non-American composer's work is considered? For example, if the work was composed in the U.S. or by an American-based composer. However, Cheb Mami is Moroccan, and his music is primarily in Arabic, so it's unlikely that his work would be considered for the Pulitzer, which is focused on American music. \n\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is usually for works that are performed in the U.S. or have significant American context. Cheb Mami's music is more associated with \n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes works that are original compositions for a musical or a musical play, with the work being produced on a professional stage in the United States.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is an Algerian singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab music scene. He has released several albums and has been recognized in his own right, but I need to check if he has any prior awards or if there's any reason he couldn't win a Pulitzer. \n\nThe key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Prize Board, which is based in the United States. The award is given for works produced in the U.S., so the musical composition must be staged there. Cheb Mami's work is primarily in Arabic music, which is a different genre from the Western musical theater that the Pulitzer typically recognizes. However, the Pulitzer does consider a variety of musical forms, including classical, jazz, and contemporary works. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer for musical composition specifically requires that the work be a \"musical\" or a \"musical play\" produced on a professional stage. Cheb Mami's work is more in the realm of pop or traditional Arabic music, which might not fit the criteria. Additionally, the Pulitzer has historically been more inclined towards Western classical and American musical theater. However, the Pulitzer does have a category for \"Music\" which includes compositions for orchestra, but that's different from musical theater. \n\nWait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded for compositions that are \"original works for orchestra, chorus, solo voice, or solo voice and orchestra, or for other ensembles, and for works for solo voice with piano or other accompaniment.\" So if Cheb Mami's work is in a different genre, like pop or traditional Arabic music, it might not qualify. \n\nHowever, the user is asking about the impossibility. Is there any absolute reason why he can't win? The Pulitzer is open to any eligible work, regardless of the artist's origin.

The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often for a stage or concert performance.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's part of the band Cheb i Sabbah, and his music blends traditional Arabic elements with contemporary styles. The key here is whether his work qualifies for the Pulitzer Prize. \n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has specific criteria. For the musical composition category, the work must be original and have been composed for performance. The Pulitzer Committee usually looks for works that are considered significant contributions to American music. However, the Pulitzer Prize is not limited to American composers. There have been instances where non-American composers have won, though it's less common. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to an American composer, right? Wait, no. Let me check. Actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is open to composers of any nationality, but the work must be composed for performance in the United States. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded by Columbia University, and the selection process considers the work's significance and quality. \n\nCheb Mami's music is primarily in Arabic, and while he may have performed in the US or collaborated with American artists, the question is whether his work could be considered for the Pulitzer. If his compositions are original and meet the criteria, then it's possible. However, the Pulitzer has a history of recognizing Western classical and American popular music. There's a possibility that his work might not be considered eligible if it doesn't fit into the categories they typically recognize. \n\nBut the question is about impossibility. Is there any reason why it's impossible? For example, if the Pulitzer Prize doesn't accept works in Arabic or doesn't consider non-American composers, then it would be impossible. However, the Pulitzer has expanded its scope over time. For instance, in 2020, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw, an American composer, but there have been other instances where international composers have been recognized. \n\nWait, but I need to verify if there are any restrictions. The Pulitzer Prize for Music requires the work to be composed for performance, and the composer must be a citizen of the United States. Wait, no, that's not accurate. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded to individuals, and the composer must be a citizen of the United States. Wait, no, actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to the composer regardless of nationality, as long as the work is composed for performance in the U.S. or has been performed there. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to the composer, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded to the work, not necessarily the nationality of the composer. For example, in 2013, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw, an American composer.

However, his work is primarily rooted in North African music, which is different from the Western classical or contemporary music that often receives Pulitzer recognition.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has a history of recognizing composers from diverse backgrounds, but the selection process is highly competitive and based on the quality and impact of the work.

However, the Pulitzer committee might consider works that are premiered in the U.S. or have a significant American presence.\n\nCheb Mami's music, while influential, is more associated with the Arab music scene.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for excellence in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often with a focus on American composers. However, the Pulitzer Prizes have expanded over time to include more diverse works, including those from international artists.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and composer known for his traditional and contemporary music. He's part of the Gnawa music tradition, which is a blend of African, Arab, and Mediterranean influences. His work often incorporates traditional instruments and rhythms. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The Pulitzer Prize for musical composition is open to any eligible work, regardless of the composer's nationality. \n2. The prize is awarded for original compositions, so if Cheb Mami has created a work that meets the criteria, he could be eligible. \n3. The Pulitzer Prizes have historically recognized a range of musical styles, though there might be a focus on Western classical music. However, there have been instances of non-traditional or world music being recognized. \n\nI should check if there are any restrictions on the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition.

Let me verify.\n\nActually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to works that are \"American\" in origin, but the composer can be from any country. However, the Pulitzer Prize for Music specifically requires that the work be composed by an American citizen. Wait, I need to check that. \n\nWait, according to the Pulitzer Prize website, the Music category is for a composition that is \"American in character\" and is composed by an American citizen. So the composer must be a U.S. citizen. If that's the case, then Cheb Mami, being Moroccan, would not be eligible unless he is a U.S. citizen. However, if he is not a U.S. citizen, then he can't win that specific prize. But the question is about whether it's impossible. \n\nSo, if the Pulitzer Prize for Music requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen, then Cheb Mami would not be eligible unless he is a citizen. However, if he is a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. But the question doesn't specify his citizenship. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the prize is open to non-American composers. I need to clarify this. \n\nLooking up the Pulitzer Prize for Music criteria: The Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composition that is \"American in character\" and is composed by an American citizen. So the composer must be a U.S. citizen. Therefore, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he cannot win this prize. \n\nBut the question is whether it's impossible for him to win. If he is a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. If he is not, then it's impossible. Since the question doesn't provide information about his citizenship, we have to assume that it's possible if he meets the criteria. However, the question is phrased as \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win...\" So the answer would depend on whether he meets the eligibility criteria. \n\nBut the question is asking if it's impossible, not whether he is eligible. So, if the Pulitzer Prize requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen, and if Cheb Mami is not, then it's impossible. However, if he is a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. Since the question doesn't specify, we can't assume his citizenship. Therefore, the answer would depend on that. \n\nBut the question is a yes/no question.

He's a Tunisian singer and songwriter, known for his work in the Arab world, especially with the band Diam's. Now, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition is awarded for original compositions in the United States.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize is given by the Pulitzer Board, which is based in the US. The prize is for works that are considered to be of high artistic merit. Cheb Mami's work is primarily in Arabic music, which might be considered as part of the broader musical composition category. However, the Pulitzer Prize typically recognizes works that are composed for American audiences or have a significant impact in the US. \n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize does have some flexibility. For example, they have awarded prizes for works that are in other languages, like the 2020 Pulitzer for Drama went to a play in English, but there have been cases where works from other countries were considered. However, the musical composition category is specific. The Pulitzer for Music is awarded for \"original compositions in the field of music,\" and it's given to a composer, not necessarily the performer. \n\nCheb Mami is a performer, not a composer. So even if his music were considered, the prize would go to the composer, not the performer. However, if he were to compose a piece that meets the Pulitzer criteria, then he could be eligible.

However, his work is primarily in Arabic and has been more associated with the North African music scene rather than the Western classical or Broadway musical traditions that the Pulitzer Prize often recognizes.\n\nBut wait, the Pulitzer Prize does consider a broad range of musical works. For example, in the past, they've awarded prizes for works that might not be traditionally Western. However, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is typically given to American composers. The Pulitzer Prizes are administered by Columbia University, and the awards are usually given to works that are produced in the United States. However, the criteria might allow for international works if they meet certain conditions, like being composed by an American citizen or being produced in the U.S.\n\nCheb Mami is a Moroccan citizen, so unless he has American citizenship or the work is produced in the U.S., it might be challenging. However, the Pulitzer Prize has occasionally recognized works by non-American composers, especially if they are American citizens or if the work is produced in the U.S. For example, there have been cases where composers from other countries have won if they meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nBut the question is about whether it's impossible. If there's any possibility that Cheb Mami could meet the criteria, then the answer would be no. However, if the criteria are strictly limited to American composers, then it's impossible. The Pulitzer Prize's official guidelines state that the work must be composed by an American citizen. So if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he wouldn't be eligible. However, he might have dual citizenship or have been naturalized. If he hasn't, then it's impossible.\n\nBut I don't have current information on Cheb Mami's citizenship status.

However, the question is about whether it's impossible for him to win. If there's any possibility, even if he's not a U.S. citizen, perhaps through a different category or if the rules change, then the answer would be no.

He's associated with the Andalusian music style, which has roots in Islamic Spain and incorporates elements from Arabic, Berber, and Andalusian traditions. His work is more in the realm of traditional and folk music rather than Western classical or contemporary classical music, which are the usual categories for Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nHowever, the Pulitzer Prize is not limited to Western classical music. While the majority of Pulitzer winners in the music category are in classical or contemporary classical genres, there might be exceptions. For example, there have been instances where works from different musical traditions have been recognized, especially if they are considered significant and innovative.

However, the composer can be of any nationality. So, if Cheb Mami composed a piece that meets the Pulitzer's criteria, he could be eligible. However, the question is about impossibility. Is there any reason why he couldn't win?\n\nThe main challenges might be cultural or genre-related. The Pulitzer often favors Western classical music, but there have been exceptions. For instance, in 2022, the Pulitzer for Music was awarded to Caroline Shaw for her work, which is contemporary classical. But there's no rule that says only Western classical music is eligible. If Cheb Mami's composition is considered a significant work in the field of music, even if it's in a different style, it might be eligible. \n\nAnother angle: the Pulitzer Prize is awarded to U.S. citizens. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded to individuals regardless of nationality, as long as the work is eligible. For example, the prize can be awarded to non-U.S. citizens if the work is considered part of the American music scene. However, the composer's nationality might affect eligibility. Wait, no, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to the composer, and the composer can be any nationality. For example, in 2021, the Pulitzer Prize for Music was awarded to Missy Mazzoli, an American composer, but there have been instances where non-American composers have won, though I can't recall specific examples. \n\nWait, actually, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition, and the work must be composed in the United States. Wait, no, the work doesn't have to be composed in the U.S., but the composer must be a U.S. citizen? Or is that not a requirement? Let me check. \n\nAccording to the Pulitzer Prize website, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is awarded to a composer for an original composition. The composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, that's not accurate. The Pulitzer Prize is given to individuals who are U.S. citizens. So, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he wouldn't be eligible. However, the question is whether it's impossible for him to win. If he is not a U.S. citizen, then he can't win the Pulitzer Prize for Music. But if he is a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. \n\nWait, but Cheb Mami is Tunisian, so he's not a U.S. citizen. Unless he has dual citizenship. But the question doesn't specify. Assuming he's not a U.S. citizen, then he can't be eligible for the Pulitzer Prize. However, if he were a U.S. citizen, then it's possible. But the question is about impossibility. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether Cheb Mami is a U.S. citizen. If he isn't, then it's impossible. But if he is, then it's possible. Since the question doesn't provide information about his citizenship, perhaps the answer is that it's possible, but not certain. However, the question is asking whether it's impossible. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win...\" So, if there's any possibility that he could win, the answer is no. If it's impossible regardless of circumstances, then yes. \n\nSince Cheb Mami is Tunisian, and the Pulitzer requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen (or perhaps not?), but if the Pulitzer allows non-U.S. citizens, then it's possible. But I'm not sure. Let me check the actual criteria. \n\nLooking up the Pulitzer Prize for Music: According to the Pulitzer Prize website, the award is given to a composer for an original composition. The composer must be a U.S. citizen. Wait, no, that's not stated. Let me check. \n\nActually, the Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to individuals who are citizens of the United States. So, if Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he cannot be awarded a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, if he is not a U.S. citizen, then it's impossible for him to win. However, the question is whether it's impossible. If there's a possibility that he could become a U.S. citizen, then it's not impossible. \n\nBut the question is about the current situation. Since\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Is it impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition?\" The user wants a yes/no answer in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Cheb Mami is. From what I know, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan musician known for his work in the Arab music scene, blending traditional and modern styles. He's been active in the music industry, so he's likely a composer and performer.\n\nNext, the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in various categories, including music. The prize is given to a composer for an original work that has been performed in the United States. The criteria include the work being a composition for orchestra, chorus, or solo instrument, and it must be premiered in the U.S. within the past year.\n\nNow, the key here is whether Cheb Mami's work meets the criteria for the Pulitzer. Since he's a Moroccan artist, his work might not have been premiered in the U.S. unless he has collaborated with American ensembles or had his work performed there. But the Pulitzer does consider works by international composers if they meet the performance criteria. However, the prize is typically awarded to American composers, though there have been exceptions.\n\nWait, the Pulitzer Prize for Music is open to composers of any nationality, as long as the work meets the criteria. For example, in the past, there have been non-American composers who have won the prize. However, the work must be performed in the U.S. So if Cheb Mami has a composition that was premiered in the U.S., he could be eligible. But if his work hasn't been performed there, then he wouldn't be eligible.\n\nBut the question is about whether it's impossible. So the answer depends on whether there's any possibility that Cheb Mami could meet the criteria. If there's a possibility, then the answer is no; if it's impossible, th\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievement in various fields, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes works that are original and of high artistic merit.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and composer known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's been active in the music industry for several decades. To win a Pulitzer Prize, his work would need to meet the high standards set by the Pulitzer committee. The Pulitzer Prize is not limited to any particular genre or cultural origin, so theoretically, any eligible work could be considered.\n\nHowever, there are a few factors to consider. The Pulitzer Prize for music is usually awarded for works that are composed for performance, often in the Western classical tradition. Cheb Mami's music is rooted in traditional Arabic music, which might be different from the Western classical style that the Pulitzer often recognizes. But the Pulitzer has expanded its scope over time to include a broader range of musical styles, so it's not impossible.\n\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Prize is awarded by the Pulitzer Board, which evaluates the work based on its\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, so the question is whether it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works, often for the stage, and the composer must be a U.S. citizen. The prize is given to a single composer each year, and the work must be a musical composition that has been performed publicly.\n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and songwriter known for his work in the Arab world, particularly in the genre of ra\u00ef. He's been active since the 1980s and has gained international recognition. However, he's not a U.S. citizen. The Pulitzer Prize requires the composer to be a U.S. citizen, as per the rules set by the Pulitzer Prize Board. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a way around that? Let me check. The Pulitzer Prizes are administered by Columbia University, and the rules state that the winner must be a citizen of the United States. So even if someone is a citizen of another country, like Morocco, they wouldn't be eligible unless they are also a U.S. citizen. \n\nCheb Mami's music is primarily in Arabic, and his works are more associated with the Arab music scene. The Pulitzer Prize for music usually looks for works that are in the Western classical tradition or American popular music. However, the prize is open to any nationality as long as the composer is a U.S. citizen. \n\nBut since Cheb Mami is not a U.S. citizen, he wouldn't be eligible regardless of the quality of his work. Therefore, it's impossible for him to win the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition because he doesn't meet the citizen\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if it's impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. I need to answer yes or no.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually in various categories, including music. The musical composition category typically recognizes original works of music, such as operas, symphonies, or other significant compositions. The prize is given to individuals or groups, so it's possible for a composer to win if their work meets the criteria.\n\nNow, who is Cheb Mami? From what I know, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan singer and composer known for his work in the Arabic music scene. He's been recognized for his contributions to music, especially in the North African region. However, I'm not sure about his specific works or whether he has been nominated or won any major awards.\n\nThe key here is whether it's impossible for him to win a Pulitzer. The Pulitzer Prize is not limited to any particular region or ethnicity, so theoretically, any qualified composer could win. However, the Pulitzer is a prestigious award, and the selection process is rigorous. Cheb Mami's work might not be in the style that the Pulitzer committee typically recognizes. For example, the Pulitzer for music has historically been awarded to composers in the Western classical tradition, though there have been exceptions. However, the criteria for the prize include originality, artistic merit, and significance.\n\nIf Cheb Mami's compositions are considered original and of high artistic merit, and if they fit within the scope of the Pulitzer's criteria, then it's possible he could win. However, if his work is not in the traditional Western classical genre, it might be less likely. But the Pulitzer has expanded over time to include a broader range of musical styles. For example, in the past, there have been awards for works that incorporate elements of different musical traditions.\n\nSo, is it impossible? Well, \"impossible\" is a strong term. Unless there are specific restrictions, like the Pulitzer only being awarded to American citizens, but I don't think that's the case. The Pulitzer is open to works created in the United States, but the composer doesn't necessarily have to be American. Wait, actually, the Pulitzer Prize is awarded for works that are produced in the United States, but the composer can be from anywhere. However, the award is given to the composer, so if Cheb Mami is a Moroccan citizen, but his work is considered American, perhaps? Or does the Pulitzer require the work to be composed in the US or have a US connection?\n\nThis is a bit unclear. If Cheb Mami's work is not associated with the US, then he might not be eligible. However, the Pulitzer has had international recognition in some cases. For example, the Pulitzer Prize for Music has been awarded to composers from outside the US, such as in the case of some contemporary composers. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, the Pulitzer might require the work to be composed in the US. If that's the case, then if Cheb Mami's composition\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

First, I need to recall what the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition entails. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for distinguished achievement in the field of music, and it's given to a composer for a musical composition. \n\nNow, Cheb Mami is a Moroccan musician known for his work in the traditional Arabic music genre, particularly with the oud. He's been recognized for his contributions to music, such as the Grammy Award he won in 2012 for Best Traditional World Music Album. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the Pulitzer Prize for music is open to any composer, regardless of their background or origin. The prize is not restricted to any particular genre or nationality. Since Cheb Mami is a composer who has already received international recognition, it's theoretically possible for him to be considered for a Pulitzer Prize. \n\nHowever, I should check if there are any restrictions. The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded by the Pulitzer Board, which is part of Columbia University. The criteria for the music category typically require the work to be of high artistic quality and to be composed for performance. Cheb Mami's compositions, if they meet these criteria, could be eligible. \n\nBut wait, there's a catch. The Pulitzer Prize for music is awarded to a single person, and the prize is given for a specific composition. Cheb Mami's work is in the traditional world music genre. While the Pulitzer has previously awarded prizes to composers in various genres, including classical and contemporary, the question is whether his work would be eligible. \n\nAlso, the Pulitzer Prize for music has been awarded to composers like George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, and others.
