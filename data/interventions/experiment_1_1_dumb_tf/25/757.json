      "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. Let me start by recalling Pink Floyd's discography. They have several well-known songs and albums. The French Riviera, also known as the C\u00f4te d'Azur, is a coastal area in southeastern France. \n\nI remember that Pink Floyd's song \"The French Riviera\" is actually a track from their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" Wait, no, I think that's not right. Let me think again. Oh, maybe it's from a different album. Another possibility is that the song is part of their earlier work. \n\nWait, I think \"The French Riviera\" is a track from their 1975 album \"Wish You Were Here.\" Let me check that. No, \"Wish You Were Here\" has songs like \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" and \"Have a Cigar.\" Maybe I'm mixing up the songs. \n\nAlternatively, could it be from the \"Animals\" album? That album has \"Pigs on the Wing,\" \"Dogs,\" and \"Fox.\" Not sure. Wait, I think there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" on their album \"The Wall.\" Let me recall the tracklist of \"The Wall.\" The songs are \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1),\" \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2),\" \"Goodbye Blue Sky,\" \"You See Me, I See You,\" \"When the Tigers Broke Free,\" \"Run Like Hell,\" \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Waiting for the Worms,\" and \"The Final Cut.\" Hmm, I don't see \"The French Riviera\" there. \n\nWait, maybe it's from a live album or a compilation? Or perhaps I'm confusing it with another band. Let me think of other songs. There's \"The Wind\" which is about the wind, but not the Riviera. \n\nWait, I think the song \"The French Riviera\" is actually a track from their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" But I'm not sure. Let me try to remember the tracklist of that album. The songs are \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Us and Them,\" \"Time,\" \"Breathe,\" \"Eclipse,\" \"The Great Gig in the Sky,\" \"Money,\" \"Comfortably Numb,\" and \"Any Colour You Like.\" No, \"The French Riviera\" isn't there. \n\nWait, maybe it's from the \"Meddle\" album? The tracklist includes \"One of These Days,\" \"Echoes,\" \"Matilda Mother,\" \"Fearless,\" \"Sorrow,\" and \"Karn Evil 19\" (which is \"The Nile\"). No, that's not it either. \n\nAlternatively, could it be a song from their earlier work, like \"The Madcap Laughs\" or \"Obscured by Clouds\"? I'm not sure. Maybe I should check if there's a song with the French Riviera in the title. \n\nWait, I think I might be confusing it with a song by another artist. For example, The Rolling Stones have a song called \"French Connection,\" but that's not about the Riviera. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the song is part of a live performance or a B-side. Let me think. I recall that Pink Floyd's song \"The French Riviera\" was released as a single in 1973, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, I think that song was actually released as a single in 1973, but I'm not sure if it's part of their official albums. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a track from the \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" album, which was released in 1987. That album has songs like \"Keep It Quiet,\" \"Not Now John,\" \"The Gun,\" \"What Do You Want On Earth,\" etc. Still no. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall if there's a song by Pink Floyd that specifically references the French Riviera. I think the answer is no. Maybe the user is thinking of a different band. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a song in their discography that mentions the French Riviera. For example, \"The Wind\" might have some references, but I don't think so. \n\nWait, after checking my memory, I think that Pink Floyd did not have a song titled \"The French Riviera.\" However, there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by The Alan Parsons Project, which is a different band. That song is from their album \"Tales of Mystery and Imagination.\" So, the user might be confusing the bands. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be no, Pink Floyd did not have a song about the French Riviera. The song exists by another band. So the correct answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. Let me start by recalling Pink Floyd's discography. They have several well-known songs and albums. The French Riviera, also known as the C\u00f4te d'Azur, is a coastal region in southeastern France, famous for places like Nice, Cannes, and Saint-Tropez.\n\nFirst, I'll think about their most popular songs. \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" \"Hey You,\" \"Time,\" \"Money,\" \"Eclipse,\" \"Interstellar Overdrive,\" \"The Wall,\" \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" \"Pigs on the Wing,\" \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,\" \"Arnold Layne,\" \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene,\" \"The Great Gig in the Sky,\" \"Meddle,\" \"The Division Bell,\" \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\" \"The Final Cut,\" and \"The Wall.\" \n\nWait, I'm not sure if any of these are about the French Riviera. Let me think if any of their songs reference locations in France. \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" is about a spaceship, not the Riviera. \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" is more about a spiritual journey. \"Wish You Were Here\" is about a friend who's away, but not a specific place. \n\nI remember that \"The Wall\" album has a song called \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" but that's more about the structure of the wall. \"Comfortably Numb\" is about a patient's experience. \n\nWait, there's a song called \"The Bends\" from the album \"The Division Bell,\" but that's about a relationship. Maybe \"High Hopes\" from the same album? No, that's more about a place called High Hopes, which is a song title, not a location. \n\nWait, maybe \"The French Riviera\" is a song title? I don't recall that. Let me check some of their albums. The album \"Meddle\" has \"One of These Days\" and \"Echoes.\" \"Echoes\" is a long track, but not about a place. \n\nWait, could it be \"The Trial\" from the album \"The Wall\"? No, that's about a trial. \n\nWait, maybe \"Run Like Hell\" from \"The Wall\" or \"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2.\" Not related. \n\nI think I need to consider if any of their songs have lyrics referencing the French Riviera. Let me think of the lyrics. For example, \"Wish You Were Here\" has \"I'd give anything just to be in your place\" but that's not the Riviera. \n\nWait, there's a song called \"The Pink Floyd\" which is a song about the band, but not the Riviera. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a less popular song? Let me think. \"Interstellar Overdrive\" is about space. \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" is about a man who's been killed. \n\nWait, perhaps \"The Final Cut\" has a song about a place? \"The Final Cut\" is the album, and the song \"The Final Cut\" is about a war. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think if any of their songs have references to France or the Riviera. I can't recall any. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a song like \"In the Flesh\" from the album \"The Division Bell\" \u2013 no, that's about a place called In the Flesh, which is a song title. \n\nWait, maybe \"The Last Time\" from the album \"The Wall\" \u2013 no, that's about the band's history. \n\nI think it's possible that there's no song by Pink Floyd specifically about the French Riviera. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there's a lesser-known track? Or perhaps a live performance? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the song \"The French Riviera\" is a lesser-known track. Let me try to recall. I don't think so. \n\nI think the answer is no, they didn't have a song about the French Riviera. So the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. Let me start by recalling Pink Floyd's songs. They have a lot of famous tracks, like \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" and \"Wish You Were Here.\" Wait, there's also \"The Wall\" album, but I don't remember a song specifically about the French Riviera.\n\nMaybe I should think about their lyrics. The French Riviera is known for places like Nice, Cannes, and Monaco. Any song with references to those areas? I remember \"On the Run\" from the album \"The Wall,\" but that's more about escaping from the Wall, not the Riviera. \n\nWait, there's a song called \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" but that's part of the \"The Wall\" album too, and it's about a friend. What about \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\"? No, that's about a man with an axe. \n\nWait, maybe \"The French Riviera\" is a song by another artist? Or perhaps a lesser-known track. Let me think. I don't recall any Pink Floyd songs that mention the French Riviera. Maybe I should check some of their albums. \n\nTheir album \"The Division Bell\" has songs like \"High Hopes\" and \"Wearing the Inside Out,\" but nothing about the Riviera. \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" has \"The Dogs,\" but again, not related. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a song with a French title or a reference to the area. Wait, \"The Wall\" has a song called \"Hey You,\" but that's not it. \n\nI think the answer is no. Pink Floyd didn't have a song specifically about the French Riviera. So the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. First, I need to recall Pink Floyd's songs and their themes. I know they have a lot of songs with vivid imagery and sometimes specific locations.\n\nI remember that \"The Wall\" is one of their famous albums, but I don't think that's about the French Riviera. Then there's \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" but again, not sure about that. Wait, there's a song called \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" which is about Syd Barrett, their former member. Not related to the Riviera.\n\nWait, maybe \"Echoes\" from the album Meddle? That's a long song, but I don't recall it mentioning the French Riviera. Let me think of other songs. There's \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" but those are more about personal feelings or the music industry.\n\nWait, what about \"The French Riviera\" itself? Is there a song with that title? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a lesser-known track. Let me try to think if any of their songs reference the French Riviera. The French Riviera is also known as the Cote d'Azur. Maybe a song like \"Cymbaline\" from the album The Wall? No, that's a different topic. \n\nAlternatively, could it be a song from a live album or a B-side? I'm not certain. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" from The Dark Side of the Moon? That's about a spaceship and a journey, not the Riviera. \n\nWait, perhaps \"The Trial\" from The Wall? That's a narrative about a trial, not a location. Hmm. Maybe I should check if any of their songs have lyrics that mention the French Riviera. For example, \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" has the line \"We don't need no education,\" but no reference to the Riviera. \n\nI'm not recalling any specific song by Pink Floyd that directly references the French Riviera. I think the answer is no. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there's a song I'm forgetting. Alternatively, could it be a song from a different album or a live performance? I don't think so. So, I'll go with false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. Let me think. I know Pink Floyd is a famous rock band from the 60s and 70s.

Maybe they have a song that refers to that area. Let me recall their discography. There's \"The Wall,\" \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" and others. \n\nI remember a song called \"The French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd. Wait, is that correct? Or maybe it's a different band? Let me think. Oh, wait, there's a song by The Kinks called \"French Riviera,\" but that's not Pink Floyd. Maybe I'm confusing the bands. \n\nAlternatively, maybe one of their songs has a lyric that references the French Riviera indirectly. For example, \"Another Brick in the Wall\" has some imagery, but I don't think it's about the Riviera. \"Comfortably Numb\" is more about a mental state. \n\nI should check if there's any song titled \"French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd. Let me try to recall their song titles. I don't think they have a song with that exact title. Maybe there's a track that mentions the area in the lyrics? \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a song from one of their albums. For example, \"The Wall\" album has \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" but not sure about the Riviera. \n\nWait, I think there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by a different artist. Maybe I'm mixing up the bands. Let me try to think again. \n\nNo, I think the answer is that Pink Floyd didn't have a song specifically about the French Riviera. The Kinks have that song, but not Pink Floyd. So the answer would be no. Therefore, the decision is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. Let me start by recalling Pink Floyd's songs. They have a lot of songs, but I'm trying to remember if any of them mention the French Riviera specifically. \n\nI know they have a song called \"The French Riviera\" from their album \"The Wall.\" Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Let me think. There's a song called \"The Wall\" which is an album, but I think there's a track named \"The French Riviera.\" Or maybe it's part of a song? \n\nWait, I think the song is actually called \"The French Riviera\" and it's part of the \"The Wall\" album. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check some details. The song \"The French Riviera\" is a track on the album \"The Wall,\" released in 1979. The song is about a man who is a former soldier, and the lyrics mention the French Riviera as a place he's associated with. \n\nSo, yes, Pink Floyd did have a song titled \"The French Riviera.\" Therefore, the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure I'm not confusing it with another song. Let me think of other songs. There's \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" but none of those seem to mention the French Riviera. \n\nAnother way to confirm: the song \"The French Riviera\" is part of the concept album \"The Wall,\" which tells the story of a man's descent into madness. The song's lyrics talk about his time in the military and his experiences, including the French Riviera. So yes, the answer is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. First, I need to recall Pink Floyd's songs and their themes. I know they have a lot of songs with metaphorical or conceptual lyrics, but I'm not sure if any specifically mention the French Riviera.\n\nI remember their album \"The Wall\" has songs like \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" but that's more about societal issues. Then there's \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" which includes tracks like \"Time\" and \"Money,\" but again, not sure about the Riviera. \n\nWait, there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd? Maybe it's from one of their earlier albums. Let me think. I think they had a song called \"The French Riviera\" on their 1967 album \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\" Wait, no, that album's songs are more psychedelic and include \"See Emily Play\" and \"Interstellar Overdrive.\" Maybe I'm mixing up the titles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the song is called \"The French Riviera\" from a different album. I'm trying to remember if any of their songs reference that area. Another thought: sometimes songs have titles that are places, but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the song is \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" but that's about Syd Barrett. Maybe \"Echoes\" from the album \"Meddle,\" but that's more about a long instrumental. \n\nWait, I think there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd. Let me check my memory. Oh, wait, I think it's from the album \"The Wall,\" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a track from \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" or another album. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the song is \"Machines\" or \"Comfortably Numb,\" but those don't reference the Riviera. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is thinking of a song that's not by Pink Floyd. Maybe it's another artist. But the question specifically asks about Pink Floyd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the song is \"The Pink Floyd Song\" from their album \"The Wall,\" but that's not about the Riviera. \n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think of the French Riviera as a location. Are there any Pink Floyd songs that mention places in France? I can't recall any. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the song is \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" from \"The Division Bell,\" but that's about a love story, not the Riviera. \n\nWait, I think there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd. Let me try to confirm. If I remember correctly, the song is on their 1967 album \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's from \"A Saucerful of Secrets.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is mistaken, and there's no such song. I might need to check my knowledge. \n\nWait, I think the song \"The French Riviera\" is actually by a different band. Or maybe it's a lesser-known track. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the song is \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,\" which is from \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" but that's not about the Riviera. \n\nI'm not certain, but I think Pink Floyd didn't have a song specifically about the French Riviera. So the answer might be no. However, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should double-check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the song is \"The Wall\" itself, but that's about a metaphorical wall, not the Riviera. \n\nAfter considering all this, I think the answer is no. There's no well-known Pink Floyd song that references the French Riviera. Therefore, the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Maybe I'm confusing with another artist. For example, there's a song by The Kinks called \"The French Riviera,\" but that's a different band. \n\nWait, I should verify. Let me try to recall if Pink Floyd ever wrote a song about the French Riviera. I don't think so. Their songs are more about themes like mental health, war, society, etc., rather than specific locations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a song like \"Money\" refers to the Riviera? No, \"Money\" is about greed and capitalism. \n\nSo, after considering their major works, I don't recall a song by Pink Floyd that specifically mentions the French Riviera.

What about \"The Trial\"? No, that's from The Wall too. Let me think of other songs. There's \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" but that's more about a person, not a place. \n\nWait, there's a song called \"San Tropez\" by Pink Floyd. San Tropez is a town in the French Riviera, right? So maybe that's the one. Let me confirm. San Tropez is a real place in the French Riviera, known for its beaches and nightlife. If Pink Floyd had a song named after it, that would be the answer. \n\nI think \"San Tropez\" is a track from their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" Wait, no, The Dark Side of the Moon was released in 1973, but San Tropez was actually a single released in 1972. Let me check the album. San Tropez is on the album \"Meddle,\" which was released in 1971. Wait, no, \"Meddle\" was 1971, but San Tropez was released as a single in 1972. Maybe it's from the \"Meddle\" album. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's from the \"The Wall\" album. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The song \"San Tropez\" is indeed by Pink Floyd. The French Riviera is also known as the C\u00f4te d'Azur, so San Tropez is a part of that. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I need to be certain. \n\nAnother approach: search my memory for any references. Pink Floyd's song \"San Tropez\" is about the French Riviera. The lyrics mention the town and the atmosphere there. So the answer is yes. Therefore, the decision should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. Let me think. I know Pink Floyd is a British rock band from the 60s and 70s, known for songs like \"Comfortably Numb\" and \"Wish You Were Here.\" But I'm not sure about a song specifically about the French Riviera.\n\nFirst, I'll recall their discography. Their most famous albums are The Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, and others. Let me think about their songs. \"The French Riviera\" isn't ringing a bell. Maybe \"San Francisco\" by Scott McKenzie? No, that's not Pink Floyd. Wait, there's a song called \"See Emily Play\" from the album Meddle. But that's about a girl named Emily, not the Riviera. \n\nWait, maybe \"The Endless River\" from the 2014 album? No, that's more about memory and loss. What about \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\"? That's a different topic. \n\nI think the French Riviera is a region in southeastern France, known for its coastal areas. Maybe there's a song that references it indirectly. Let me check some of their songs. \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" is about a friend, not the Riviera. \"Another Brick in the Wall\" is about education. \n\nWait, perhaps \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" from The Dark Side of the Moon? That's more about a mystical experience. \n\nI'm not recalling any song by Pink Floyd that directly mentions the French Riviera. Maybe it's a lesser-known track or a live performance? Alternatively, maybe it's a song by another artist that's been confused with Pink Floyd.

They have a lot of well-known tracks, but I'm trying to remember if any of them mention the French Riviera specifically.\n\nI know that \"The Wall\" is one of their famous albums, but I don't think that's about the Riviera. There's also \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" which has songs like \"Time\" and \"Money,\" but again, not sure about the Riviera. \n\nWait, there's a song called \"High Hopes.\" Let me think. The French Riviera is also known as the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Maybe \"High Hopes\" is the one? I think the lyrics mention the French Riviera. Let me try to recall the lyrics. The song starts with \"When I was a young boy, I had a dream...\" and then there's a part about \"I was a young boy, I had a dream, I thought I was a king, I thought I was a god, I thought I was a

      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. Let me think. I know Pink Floyd is a famous rock band from the 60s and 70s. They have a lot of well-known songs like \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" and \"Another Brick in the Wall.\" But I'm trying to recall if any of their songs mention the French Riviera.\n\nWait, the French Riviera is a coastal area in southeastern France, known for places like Nice, Cannes, and Monaco. Maybe they have a song that's about a place or a vibe that could be associated with that area. Let me think of their albums. Their album \"The Wall\" has \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" but that's more about a metaphorical wall. There's \"The Dark Side of the Moon,\" which has \"Money\" and \"Time,\" but I don't think those are about the Riviera.\n\nI remember a song called \"High Hopes\" from the album \"The Wall.\" Wait, no, \"High Hopes\" is by The Ramones. Maybe I'm mixing up bands. Let me think again. Oh, there's a song called \"San Tropez\" by Pink Floyd? Wait, no, that's a song by The Kinks. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with another band. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the song is \"The French Riviera\" itself. Let me think. I don't recall a song by Pink Floyd with that exact title. Let me check some of their songs. \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" from \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" \u2013 that's more about a psychedelic experience. \"Interstellar Overdrive\" is another one, but again, not about a location. \n\nWait, there's a song called \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" which is part of the \"Wish You Were Here\" album. That's about a friend, not a place. Maybe \"Echoes\" from the same album? No, that's a long instrumental. \n\nWait, maybe \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" from the 80s? That's an album, but the song \"Mother\" is about a mother, not the Riviera. \n\nAlternatively, could it be \"The Wind\" from the album \"The Wall\"? No, that's about a character in the album. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of any song that mentions the French Riviera. Let me try to think of any references. The French Riviera is sometimes called the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Maybe a song that mentions a place in that region. \n\nWait, I think there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by someone else, but not Pink Floyd. Maybe a cover? Or maybe a song that's not well-known. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a song that's about the Riviera in a more metaphorical sense. But I can't recall any Pink Floyd songs that refer to that specific location. \n\nI think the answer is no. Pink Floyd didn't have a song specifically about the French Riviera. I can't remember any song by them that mentions that place. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that Pink Floyd is a British rock band known for their progressive rock and concept albums. They have several famous songs, like \"Another Brick in the Wall\" and \"Comfortably Numb,\" but I'm not sure if any of them are about the French Riviera. \n\nWait, the French Riviera is also known as the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Maybe there's a song with that name? Let me think. I recall a song called \"The French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me try to recall their discography. \n\nLooking at their albums: The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, etc. I don't remember a song specifically titled \"The French Riviera.\" Maybe it's part of a concept album? Or perhaps it's a lesser-known track. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a song that references the French Riviera indirectly. For example, \"San Francisco\" by Scott McKenzie comes to mind, but that's not by Pink Floyd. \n\nWait, I think there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" from their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" No, actually, that album's tracks are \"Speak to Me,\" \"Breathe,\" \"On the Run,\" \"Time,\" etc. Not that one. \n\nWait, maybe it's from a different album. Let me think. There's a song called \"High Hopes\" from the album \"The Wall,\" but that's not about the Riviera. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a live recording or a B-side? I'm not sure. Maybe I should check some sources. But since I can't access external information, I need to rely on my memory. \n\nAnother angle: The French Riviera is a popular tourist destination, so maybe a song about it would be more of a soft rock or pop song. Pink Floyd's style is more psychedelic and progressive, so maybe not. \n\nWait, I think there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a different band. For example, The Kinks had a song called \"French Riviera,\" but that's not Pink Floyd. \n\nHmm. If I'm not sure, maybe the answer is no. But I need to be accurate. Let me try to recall. I think the song \"The French Riviera\" is actually by The Kinks, not Pink Floyd. So Pink Floyd doesn't have a song with that title. Therefore, the answer would be no. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another song. Let me think again. \"Interstellar Overdrive\" is one of their songs, but that's not about the Riviera. \"Money\" is another, but again, not related. \n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. If I can't recall a specific song by Pink Floyd about the French Riviera, the answer is probably no. Therefore, the decision would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. Let me start by recalling Pink Floyd's songs. They have a lot of well-known tracks like \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" and \"The Wall.\" Wait, there's also \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" but I don't think that's about the French Riviera.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about their album \"The Wall.\" The song \"Another Brick in the Wall\" is from that album, but I don't remember any references to the French Riviera there. What about \"Hey You\"? No, that's more about the protagonist in the album. \n\nWait, there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd? I'm not sure. Let me think. I recall that the song \"High Hopes\" is from their album \"The Division Bell,\" but that's about a different topic. Maybe \"Time\" or \"Money\"? No, those are more about time and money. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up bands. There's a song by The Kinks called \"French Riviera,\" but that's not Pink Floyd. Let me check some of their songs again. \"Interstellar Overdrive\" is a longer track, but not about the Riviera. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a live performance or a B-side? I'm not certain. Wait, I think \"The French Riviera\" isn't a song by Pink Floyd. The Kinks have that song, but Pink Floyd doesn't. So the answer would be no. But I should make sure. Let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: the French Riviera is a place in France, known for beaches and resorts. Maybe a song about a vacation spot? Pink Floyd's \"Wish You Were Here\" is about being away from home, but not specifically the Riviera. \"Comfortably Numb\" is about a hospital, I think. \n\nI can't recall any song by Pink Floyd that specifically mentions the French Riviera. Therefore, the answer is probably false. But I should double-check. Maybe \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\"? No, that's about a spaceship. \n\nI think I'm confident that Pink Floyd didn't have a song about the French Riviera. The Kinks did, but not Pink Floyd. So the answer is no.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

That's more about a person's life and death, not a place. Maybe \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\"? No, that's about a man who's a racist and gets killed by a guy with an axe. Not related to the Riviera.\n\nWait, there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by another artist? Maybe I'm confusing it with someone else. Let me think. No, Pink Floyd's songs...

No. Maybe \"Echoes\"? No. I'm not remembering any song that specifically mentions the French Riviera. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a lesser-known track? Let me think. There's a song called \"The Game\" from the album \"The Wall,\" but that's about a school system. Maybe \"Pearly Gates\"? No. \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing them with another band. Like, maybe The Doors had a song about the French Riviera? No, I think that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a song that references the area indirectly. For example, \"The Gunner's Dance\" from \"The Wall\" has some imagery, but I don't think it's about the Riviera. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a live performance or a B-side? I'm not sure. Let me think of their song titles. \"Interstellar Overdrive,\" \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,\" \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene.\" None of these seem to reference the French Riviera. \n\nWait, maybe \"Dogs\" from the album \"The Wall\"? No, that's about dogs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a song from their earlier albums. \"Arnold Layne\" is about a man in a car, but not the Riviera. \n\nI think I might be mixing up with another artist. Maybe The Kinks had a song about the French Riviera? Like \"Waterloo Sunset\"? No, that's about London. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a song that's not as well-known. Let me try to recall. Wait, there's a song called \"The French Riviera\" by Pink Floyd? I'm not sure. Maybe it's part of a live album or a compilation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no. Because I can't recall any Pink Floyd song that specifically mentions the French Riviera. So the answer would be false. But I should double-check. \n\nWait, maybe \"The Last Smile\" from their album \"The Wall\"? No, that's about a character. \n\nI think I'm going to have to go with no, so the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Let me think. I remember that they have a song titled \"The French Riviera\" from their album \"The Wall.\" Wait, no, maybe that's a different album. Let me check my memory. Oh, right, \"The French Riviera\" is actually a song from their 1975 album \"Wish You Were Here.\" Wait, no, I might be mixing up the details. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's from the \"Dark Side of the Moon\" album. But I'm not certain. Let me try to recall. The song \"The French Riviera\" is actually a track on their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" Wait, no, that album's tracks include \"Money,\" \"Time,\" etc. Maybe I'm confusing it with another song. \n\nWait, I think the song is called \"The French Riviera\" and it's part of their \"Wish You Were Here\" album. Let me check. Wait, no, \"Wish You Were Here\" has songs like \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" and \"Welcome to the Machine.\" Maybe I'm mixing up the songs. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the song is called \"Saudade (Lisbon)\" which is about Lisbon, not the French Riviera. Wait, the French Riviera is in France, so maybe the song is about that area. \n\nWait, I think the correct answer is that Pink Floyd did have a song called \"The French Riviera.\" Let me confirm. Yes, \"The French Riviera\" is a track from their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" Wait, no, the Dark Side of the Moon was released in 1973, and the tracks are \"Money,\" \"Us and Them,\" \"Time,\" etc. So maybe I'm mistaken. \n\nWait, maybe it's from the album \"The Wall.\" No, The Wall was 1982. Let me think again. Oh, I think the song \"The French Riviera\" is actually a part of the album \"Wish You Were Here,\" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different band. Wait, I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no. Wait, I should check if there's a song by Pink Floyd that refers to the French Riviera. Let me think of the lyrics. I remember a song that has a line about \"the French Riviera\" but I can't recall the exact song title. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"The Game\" or \"Another Brick in the Wall,\" but those don't seem related. Wait, I think the correct answer is that Pink Floyd did have a song titled \"The French Riviera,\" which is part of their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look it up. But since I can't access external sources, I need to rely on my memory. \n\nWait, I think the song is actually \"The French Riviera\" from the album \"Wish You Were Here,\" but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different song. If I can't recall the exact album, maybe the answer is no. However, I think the correct answer is yes. Because I remember that there is a song by Pink Floyd that references the French Riviera. \n\nWait, I think the correct answer is yes.

Is that the one? San Tropez is a town in the French Riviera. Let me confirm. Yes, \"San Tropez\" is a track from their 1975 album \"Wish You Were Here.\" The song is about the French Riviera, specifically referencing San Tropez. So the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure I'm not confusing it with another song. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"The French Riviera\" is a different song. But I don't recall that title. \"San Tropez\" is the correct one.
