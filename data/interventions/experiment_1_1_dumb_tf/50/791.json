      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Lionel Richie is related to Sheila E. Let me start by recalling what I know about both of them.\n\nLionel Richie is a singer, songwriter, and musician. He's known for being part of the Commodores and then having a successful solo career. Sheila E is also a musician, known for her work as a drummer and percussionist, and she's been part of the band Prince's group, The New Power Generation. \n\nNow, the question is about their relation. I remember that Sheila E's father is the famous musician James Brown. Wait, James Brown is a legendary singer, and Sheila E's full name is Sheila Escovedo. So her father is James Brown, right? But Lionel Richie... I don't think he's related to James Brown. \n\nWait, maybe there's some connection I'm missing. Let me think. Lionel Richie was married to Diane Keaton, I believe. And he has children, but I don't recall any connection to Sheila E. On the other hand, Sheila E's father is James Brown, so if there's any relation, it would be through James Brown. But Lionel Richie isn't related to James Brown. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a family connection through someone else? Let me check. I know that Lionel Richie's daughter is named Chantal, and he has other kids. But Sheila E's family includes her father James Brown and her mother, who is a dancer. There's no mention of Lionel Richie in her family tree. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they were in the same industry or had some collaboration, but that's not a family relation. So, unless there's some distant family connection that I'm not aware of, they aren't related. \n\nI think the answer is no. They aren't related. So the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Lionel Richie is related to Sheila E. Let me start by recalling what I know about both of them.\n\nFirst, Lionel Richie is a singer, songwriter, and musician. He's known for hits like \"Hello\" and \"All Night Long.\" He's also part of the Commodores, a band he was in before his solo career. He's married to Brenda Harvey, and they have children. I don't remember any mention of his family having a connection to Sheila E.\n\nNow, Sheila E. is another musician, known for her work as a drummer and backing vocalist. She's been part of various projects, including working with Prince. She's also a producer and has her own music career. I think she's from the same era as Lionel Richie, maybe the 80s. \n\nWait, I should check if they are related by family. I don't recall any information suggesting they are siblings or related by marriage. I remember that Sheila E. was a member of Prince's band, and Lionel Richie was part of the Commodores. They might have had some collaborations or mutual connections in the music industry, but that doesn't mean they are related. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people get confused with similar names or namesakes. Let me check their full names. Lionel Richie's full name is Lionel Charles Richie. Sheila E. is Sheila Escovedo. The last names are different. Are they related through their families? I don't think so. \n\nI should also consider if they have any family ties through marriage. For example, if one of them married into the other's family. But from what I know, Lionel Richie's wife is Brenda Harvey, and Sheila E. is married to someone else. I don't think there's a connection there. \n\nWait, maybe they are related through their parents or something else? Let me think. Sheila E. was born in 1963, and Lionel Richie was born in 1949. They are about the same age, but that doesn't imply a family relation. \n\nI think the answer is no. They are both musicians but not related by family. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

He's also known for his work with Lionel Richie and the Commodores. Sheila E. is another musician, known for her work as a drummer and percussionist, and she's also a singer. She's been part of projects with Prince, like the song \"When Doves Cry,\" and she's worked with other artists too.\n\nNow, I need to check if they have any family ties. Let me think. I recall that Sheila E. is the daughter of the legendary musician James Brown. Wait, James Brown is the \"Godfather of Soul.\" So Sheila E. is his daughter. But what about Lionel Richie? His parents were Lionel Richie Sr. and Barbara Richie. I don't think he's related to James Brown. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another connection. Let me verify. Lionel Richie's father was a jazz trumpeter, and his mother was a singer. No mention of James Brown there. Sheila E.'s father is James Brown, and her mother is a dancer. So unless there's some distant family connection that I'm not aware of, they don't share a family link. \n\nI think they are not related. So the answer should be no.

But Lionel Richie and Sheila E. have different last names, so that's unlikely. \n\nI should verify if there's any record of them being related. Maybe through a shared family member? For example, if they were cousins or siblings. But I don't think so. \n\nLooking up some quick facts: Sheila E. is the daughter of Dr. Bobby E.

I think Lionel Richie was married to Susie, who was Prince's sister. So that would make Sheila E. and Lionel Richie related through marriage. Because Sheila E. was married to Prince, and Lionel Richie was married to Prince's sister. So they are in-laws.

Or maybe they are related by marriage? Or perhaps they have a family connection?\n\nWait, I think there's a possibility that Sheila E. is related to Lionel Richie through marriage. Let me check. Wait, no, I think Sheila E. was married to Prince, and Prince was married to Mayte Garcia. So maybe there's no direct relation. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a family connection. Let me think. Lionel Richie's family includes his wife, Diane Keaton, but she's not related to Sheila E. So, unless there's some extended family connection, which I don't recall. \n\nWait, I think I might be mixing up some information. Let me try to recall. I think Sheila E. is the daughter of the famous percussionist, who was also a member of the band The Commodores. Wait, the Commodores had a member named Earl Van Dusen, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Sheila E. is the daughter of the drummer from The Commodores, which is where Lionel Richie was a member. So if that's the case, maybe they are related. \n\nWait, let me check. Sheila E. is the daughter of the legendary percussionist, who was part of the Commodores. The Commodores had a drummer named Roger Troutman, but I think he was a member. However, Sheila E. was born Sheila E. Jones, and her father was the percussionist for the Commodores. Wait, but the Commodores had a member named Eddie Van Dusen, who was a drummer. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. \n\nActually, Sheila E. was born Sheila E. Jones, and her father was the drummer for the Commodores, which was Lionel Richie's band. So, if her father was a member of the Commodores, then she's related to Lionel Richie through that. But wait, the Commodores were a group that included Lionel Richie as a singer, and their drummer was someone else. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the members. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Sheila E. is related to Lionel Richie through marriage. But I don't recall any such information. Wait, no, she was married to Prince, and Prince was married to Mayte Garcia. So that's not a connection. \n\nWait, let me think again. If Sheila E. is the daughter of the drummer from the Commodores, which Lionel Richie was part of, then she's a family member of the band's drummer, but not necessarily directly related to Lionel Richie. Unless the drummer was her father and Lionel Richie was part of the same band. But that doesn't make them family. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a connection through their careers. But the question is about being related, which usually refers to family. \n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe that Sheila E. is not directly related to Lionel Richie. However, I might be missing something. Let me try to verify. \n\nUpon checking, Sheila E. is the daughter of the percussionist for the Commodores, which was a band that Lionel Richie was part of. But that would make her related to the band members, but not necessarily to Lionel Richie himself unless he was the drummer. Wait, no, the Commodores had a drummer named Roger Troutman, but he was not related to Sheila E. Wait, no, Sheila E.'s father was the drummer of the Commodores. Wait, no, the Commodores' drummer was someone else. \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. The Commodores had a drummer named Roger Troutman, who was part of the group. But Sheila E. was born Sheila E. Jones, and her father was the percussionist for the Commodores. Wait, no, the Commodores had a member named Eddie Van Dusen, who was a drummer. Wait, I think I need to check this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different connection. Let me think. If Sheila E. is related to Lionel Richie through marriage, but I don't recall any such information. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the answer is that they are not related. However, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a family connection. \n\nWait, I think I found a source in my memory. Sheila E. is the daughter of the drummer for the Commodores, which was the band that Lionel Richie was a member of. Therefore, she's related to the band members, but not necessarily to Lionel Richie himself. Unless the drummer was her father and Lionel Richie was part of the same band, but that doesn't make them family. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be no. So the decision is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Lionel Richie is related to Sheila E. Let me start by recalling what I know about both of them.\n\nFirst, Lionel Richie is a singer, songwriter, and musician. He's known for hits like \"Hello\" and \"All Night Long.\" He's also part of the Commodores, a band he was a member of. Later, he had a successful solo career. I think he's from the United States, maybe from the 70s and 80s.\n\nNow, Sheila E. She's also a musician, right? I remember her playing the congas and being part of Prince's band. She's known for her percussion skills. She's also a singer and has her own music career. I think she's from the same era as Lionel Richie, maybe late 70s to 80s. \n\nWait, are they related by family? I don't recall any information about them being siblings or family members. But maybe they have some connection through their careers? For example, did they collaborate? Let me think. I know that Sheila E. worked with Prince, and Lionel Richie was also part of Prince's band at some point. Wait, no, actually, Lionel Richie was with the Commodores, and Prince was a different artist. But maybe there was some overlap?\n\nWait, I think Prince and Lionel Richie had some collaboration. For example, Prince covered some of Lionel Richie's songs, like \"Purple Rain\" was originally by Prince, but maybe there was some collaboration. However, Sheila E. was part of Prince's band, so maybe she and Lionel Richie worked together? Or maybe they were in the same industry but not directly related.\n\nBut the question is about family relation. So, are they siblings, parents, children, or related by marriage? I don't think so. Let me check my memory. I don't recall any family ties between them. Maybe they have the same manager or something, but that's not a family relation. \n\nAlternatively, could they be related through their music styles or influences? For example, maybe they both influenced each other, but that's not a family relation. \n\nWait, I think I read somewhere that they are cousins. Wait, no, that might be a confusion with another artist. Let me think again. No, I don't think that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have the same last name? No, Lionel Richie and Sheila E. have different last names. So that's not a clue. \n\nI think the answer is no. They are both musicians from the same era, possibly collaborated in some way, but not related by family. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lionel Richie is related to Sheila E. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know Lionel Richie is a famous singer, songwriter, and musician.

She's also a musician, a drummer, and has worked with artists like Prince and David Bowie. \n\nNow, the question is about their relation. I need to check if they are family members or have any familial connection. From what I remember, Sheila E. is the daughter of percussionist and bandleader Tito Escovedo. Tito was part of the group Tito Puente's orchestra, I think. \n\nLionel Richie's family background\u2014I recall that his father was Lionel Richie Sr., a jazz trumpeter, and his mother was a singer. But I don't remember any connection between the Richie family and the Escovedo family. \n\nWait, maybe there's some connection through their careers? Like collaborating or something? But that's not a family relation. They might have worked together, but that's not related to being related by blood or marriage. \n\nI should verify if there's any known family ties. Let me think if I've heard of any such connections. I don't think so. Sheila E. and Lionel Richie might have collaborated on some projects, but that's professional, not familial. \n\nSo, based on what I know, they are not related.

He's also the father of Richie Sambora, who is a guitarist for Bon Jovi. Wait, no, actually, I think Richie Sambora is the son of Lionel Richie. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me check that again. Wait, no, Richie Sambora is actually the son of a different person. Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. Let me think. Lionel Richie's children include his daughter, Nikia, and his son, Richie, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should look up his family. But since I can't access external information, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.\n\nSheila E. is a percussionist and musician, known for her work with Prince and her own projects. She's also the daughter of the legendary musician James Brown. Wait, James Brown is her father? So Sheila E. is the daughter of James Brown. Wait, but James Brown's daughter is also named Sheila E., right? So that's her family connection. \n\nNow, the question is whether Lionel Richie is related to Sheila E. If Sheila E. is the daughter of James Brown, and Lionel Richie is the father of Richie Sambora, then unless there's some family connection between James Brown and Lionel Richie, they wouldn't be related. But I don't recall any known familial connection between them. \n\nWait, maybe there's a connection through marriage? Like, perhaps Lionel Richie married someone from James Brown's family? But I don't think that's the case. Lionel Richie's wife is Diane Fleri, and they have children together. Sheila E.'s father is James Brown, and her mother is a woman named Barbara, but I don't think she's related to Lionel Richie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a connection through their careers?

She's also a singer and has worked with various artists.\n\nNow, the key here is to determine if they are related by family. I don't recall any information that suggests they are blood relatives.

Lionel Richie was married to Diane Keaton, and Diane Keaton was the sister of Susannah Melvoin, who was Prince's sister. Wait, no, Susannah Melvoin was Prince's sister, and Diane Keaton was married to Lionel Richie. But if Diane Keaton is the sister of Susannah Melvoin, then Sheila E. would be related to Lionel Richie through their spouses. Wait, that would make Sheila E. the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check. Susannah Melvoin was Prince's sister. Prince was married to Sheila E. So Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Susannah Melvoin? No, Sheila E. was married to Prince, so Susannah Melvoin is Prince's sister, making Sheila E. the sister-in-law of Susannah Melvoin. But how does that relate to Lionel Richie? \n\nIf Diane Keaton is the sister of Susannah Melvoin, then Diane Keaton would be the sister of Prince's sister. That would make Diane Keaton the sister of Susannah, who is Prince's sister. So, Diane Keaton is the sister of Susannah Melvoin, who is Prince's sister. Therefore, Diane Keaton is the sister of Prince's sister, which would make Diane Keaton the aunt of Prince's children. But how does that connect to Lionel Richie? \n\nWait, if Lionel Richie was married to Diane Keaton, then Diane Keaton is his wife, and she is the sister of Susannah Melvoin. So, Susannah Melvoin is the sister of Lionel Richie's wife. Therefore, Sheila E., who was married to Prince (Susannah's brother), would be the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie's wife. So, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie's wife, which would make her the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. \n\nBut does that mean they are related? If Sheila E. is married to Prince, and Prince is the brother of Susannah Melvoin, who is the sister of Lionel Richie's wife, then Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie's wife, making her the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. So, they are not directly related by blood, but through marriage. However, the question is asking if they are related. So, if they are related through marriage, then technically, they are related as in-law. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different connection. Let me check if there's any family relation between Lionel Richie and Sheila E. directly. \n\nWait, I think there's a connection through their children. For example, if Sheila E. and Prince had children, and Lionel Richie had children, but I don't think they share any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a family connection through their spouses. For example, if Lionel Richie's wife is related to Sheila E.'s spouse. \n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to look up some facts. \n\nWait, according to some sources, Sheila E. was married to Prince. Prince was the brother of Susannah Melvoin. Susannah Melvoin was married to Lionel Richie's first wife, Diane Keaton? No, wait, Diane Keaton was married to Lionel Richie, and she was the sister of Susannah Melvoin. Wait, no, Susannah Melvoin was Prince's sister. So, Diane Keaton is the sister of Susannah Melvoin. So, Diane Keaton is the sister of Susannah Melvoin, who is Prince's sister. Therefore, Diane Keaton is the sister of Prince's sister, making Diane Keaton the aunt of Prince's children. \n\nSo, Lionel Richie was married to Diane Keaton, who is the sister of Susannah Melvoin. Therefore, Sheila E., who was married to Prince, is the sister-in-law of Diane Keaton, which makes her the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. So, they are related through marriage, but not by blood. \n\nBut the question is whether they are related. In a general sense, being related through marriage would mean they are related. But sometimes people might consider only blood relations. However, the question doesn't specify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a direct family connection. Let me think again. \n\nWait, I think I might have confused the names. Maybe there's a different connection. For example, is Sheila E. related to Lionel Richie through their parents? \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no direct relation. Maybe the answer is no. \n\nWait, but if they are related through marriage (as in-law), then the answer would be yes. But if the question is about blood relation, then no. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"related,\" which can sometimes mean blood relation. However, sometimes it can include in-law. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check. \n\nLooking up information: Lionel Richie's wife was Diane Keaton, who was the sister of Susannah Melvoin. Susannah Melvoin was the sister of Prince. Prince was married to Sheila E. So, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Diane Keaton, who is the wife of Lionel Richie. Therefore, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. So, they are related through marriage, which would make them related. \n\nBut the question is whether they are related. So, if the answer is yes, then the answer is true. But I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check again. \n\nDiane Keaton was married to Lionel Richie. Diane Keaton's sister was Susannah Melvoin. Susannah Melvoin was the sister of Prince. Prince was married to Sheila E. Therefore, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Susannah Melvoin, who is the sister of Prince. Therefore, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Susannah Melvoin, who is the sister of Prince. Therefore, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of the sister of Prince. Wait, no, that's not correct. \n\nWait, if Susannah is the sister of Prince, and Sheila E. is married to Prince, then Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Susannah. Susannah is the sister of Prince. Therefore, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Susannah, who is the sister of Lionel Richie's wife, Diane Keaton. So, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Diane Keaton, who is the wife of Lionel Richie. Therefore, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. So, they are related by marriage, making them in-laws. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a different connection. Alternatively, maybe they are not related at all. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no direct relation. Let me check if there's any other connection. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let me try to verify. \n\nDiane Keaton was married to Lionel Richie. She had a sister named Susannah Melvoin. Susannah Melvoin was the sister of Prince. Prince was married to Sheila E. Therefore, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Susannah Melvoin, who is the sister of Lionel Richie's wife. Therefore, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie's wife, making her the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. \n\nTherefore, they are related through marriage. \n\nSo, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I'm not sure if the question considers in-law relationships as \"related.\" But the answer might be yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the family tree. For example, if Susannah Melvoin was not the sister of Prince. Wait, Prince's full name is Prince Rogers Nelson. His siblings include Susannah Melvoin. So, yes, Susannah is his sister. \n\nSo, the answer would be yes, they are related through marriage. \n\nBut I need to confirm if that's the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no connection. \n\nWait, but according to this line of reasoning, they are related as in-laws. Therefore, the answer is yes. \n\nBut I'm not 100% certain. However, based on the information I have, I think the answer is yes. So, the JSON would be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}"

He's been in the music industry for a long time, known for hits like \"Hello\" and \"All Night Long.\" Then there's Sheila E., whose full name is Sheila Escovedo. She's also a musician, a drummer, and has worked with artists like Prince and David Bowie. \n\nNow, the question is about their relation. I need to check if they are family members or have any familial connection. From what I remember, Sheila E. is the daughter of percussionist and bandleader Tito Escovedo. Tito was part of the group Tito Puente's orchestra, I think. \n\nLionel Richie's family back\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

He's also the father of Richie Sambora, who is a guitarist for Bon Jovi. Wait, no, actually, I think Richie Sambora is the son of Lionel Richie. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me check that again. Wait, no, Richie Sambora is actually the son of a different person. Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. Let me think. Lionel Richie's children include his daughter, Nikia, and his son, Richie, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should look up his family. But since I can't access external information, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.\n\nSheila E. is a percussionist and musician, known for her work with Prince and her own projects. She's also the daughter of the legendary musician James Brown. Wait, James Brown is her father? So Sheila E. is the daughter of James Brown. Wait, but James Brown's daughter is also named Sheil\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing her with someone else. Let me think again. \n\nWait, Sheila E's real name is Sheila Escovedo. Her father is Ricardo Escovedo, and her mother is Sheila Escovedo. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing up her family. Alternatively, I recall that Sheila E's father is Lionel Richie. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because Lionel Richie's daughter is Lisa Richie, I think. \n\nWait, maybe I should recall some facts. Lionel Richie has a daughter named Lisa Richie, who is a singer as well.

She's also a singer and has worked with various artists.\n\nNow, the key here is to determine if they are related by family. I don't recall any information that suggests they are blood relatives. Let me think about their backgrounds. Lionel Richie was born in the United States, and Sheila E. was born in Mexico City.

Lionel Richie's family... I know he's married to Brenda Harvey, and they have children. But I don't recall any mention of Sheila E. being part of his family. \n\nSheila E. was born Sheila Estry, and her father was a jazz drummer named Earl Estry. She has a brother, Michael Estry.

Let me start by recalling what I know about both of them.\n\nFirst, Lionel Richie is a singer, songwriter, and musician. He's known for hits like \"Hello\" and \"All Night Long.\" He was part of the Commodores before going solo. Now, Sheila E. is also a musician, known for her work as a drummer and percussionist. She's played with Prince and has her own successful career. \n\nNow, the question is about their relation. I remember that Sheila E. was married to Prince, and Prince was the brother of the late musician Susannah Melvoin. Wait, but Lionel Richie... I think he was married to Diane Keaton, right? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check. \n\nWait, Lionel Richie's wife is Diane Keaton? Or was it someone else? No, I think he was married to Diane Keaton, but they divorced. Then he married Nicole Richie, who is a reality TV star and the daughter of Lionel Richie's first wife? Wait, no, Nicole Richie is the daughter of Lionel Richie's first wife, but I'm getting confused here. \n\nWait, Sheila E. was married to Prince. Prince was the brother of Susannah Melvoin, who was the sister of Lionel Richie's wife? No, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nWait, I think there's a connection through their spouses. Prince was married to Susannah Melvoin, and Sheila E. was married to Prince. But Lionel Richie's wife was Diane Keaton, and then later Nicole Richie. Wait, but Nicole Richie is the daughter of Lionel Richie's first wife, who was a model named Diane Keaton? Wait, no, I think Diane Keaton was his wife, and Nicole Richie is his daughter. Wait, but that would make Nicole Richie his daughter, but she's a different person. \n\nWait, maybe there's a family connection through their spouses. Let me try to recall. Prince and Sheila E. were married. Prince was the brother of the late musician Susannah Melvoin. Wait, no, Susannah Melvoin was Prince's sister. So Sheila E. married Prince, and Prince was the brother of Susannah Melvoin. But how does that relate to Lionel Richie? \n\nWait, I think there's a connection through their wives. Lionel Richie was married to Diane Keaton, and Diane Keaton was the sister of Susannah Melvoin, who was Prince's sister. Wait, no, Susannah Melvoin was Prince's sister, and Diane Keaton was married to Lionel Richie. But if Diane Keaton is the sister of Susannah Melvoin, then Sheila E. would be related to Lionel Richie through their spouses. Wait, that would make Sheila E. the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check. Susannah Melvoin was Prince's sister. Prince was married to Sheila E. So Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Susannah Melvoin? No, Sheila E. was married to Prince, so Susannah Melvoin is Prince's sister, making Sheila E. the sister-in-law of Susannah Melvoin. But how does that relate to Lionel Richie? \n\nIf Diane Keaton is the sister of Susannah Melvoin, then Diane Keaton would be the sister of Prince's sister. That would make Diane Keaton the sister of Susannah, who is Prince's sister. So, Diane Keaton is the sister of Susannah Melvoin, who is Prince's sister. Therefore, Diane Keaton is the sister of Prince's sister, which would make Diane Keaton the aunt of Prince's children. But how does that connect to Lionel Richie? \n\nWait, if Lionel Richie was married to Diane Keaton, then Diane Keaton is his wife, and she is the sister of Susannah Melvoin. So, Susannah Melvoin is the sister of Lionel Richie's wife. Therefore, Sheila E., who was married to Prince (Susannah's brother), would be the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie's wife. So, Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie's wife, which would make her the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. \n\nBut does that mean they are related? If Sheila E. is married to Prince, and Prince is the brother of Susannah Melvoin, who is the sister of Lionel Richie's wife, then Sheila E. is the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie's wife, making her the sister-in-law of Lionel Richie. So, they are not directly related by blood, but through marriage. However, the question is asking if they are related. So, if they are related through marriage, then technically, they are related as in-law. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different connection. Let me check if there's any family relation between Lionel Richie and Sheila E. directly. \n\nWait, I think there's a connection through their children. For example, if Sheila E. and Prince had children, and Lionel Richie had children, but I don't think they share any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a family connection through their spouses. For example, if Lionel Richie's wife is related to Sheila E.'s spouse. \n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try \n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.
