      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether it's uncommon for a high schooler to use the yellow pages. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the yellow pages are. They're directories of businesses, right? Like listings of companies, services, phone numbers, etc. But I think they've become less common with the rise of the internet and online search engines. People now just search online instead of flipping through physical directories.\n\nNow, considering a high schooler. High schoolers are typically teenagers, maybe around 14-18 years old. Their primary way of getting information would be through the internet, social media, maybe apps. They might use search engines like Google to find things. The yellow pages are a physical book, so accessing them would require having a physical copy, which is not something most people have anymore. \n\nAlso, high schoolers might not need the yellow pages for their daily activities. They might need information for school projects, but even then, they'd probably use online resources. If they needed a business's contact info, they'd search online instead of using yellow pages. \n\nAnother angle: are there any situations where a high schooler might use yellow pages? Maybe if they're doing a project that requires local business listings, but even then, they might use online directories like Yelp or Google Maps. Also, the yellow pages are more for local businesses, but again, online alternatives are more accessible. \n\nSo, given that the yellow pages are outdated and less commonly used, especially by younger people who are more tech-savvy, it would be uncommon for a high schooler to use them. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's uncommon.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

Their main activities are school, maybe part-time jobs, socializing, and hobbies. Do they need to look up businesses? Maybe if they need a service like a tutor, a mechanic, or a store. But how common is that? \n\nIn the past, people used yellow pages to find local businesses. But with the internet, most people now search online. High schoolers might not have the same need as adults. They might not need to look up services as often. Also, they might not have the experience or necessity to use them. \n\nHowever, maybe some high schoolers do use them for specific reasons. For example, if they're doing a project that requires finding local businesses, or if they need a service and don't have internet access. But is that common? I think it's more common for adults to use yellow pages. For teens, it's probably less common. \n\nSo the answer would be yes, it's uncommon.
