      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if Woodrow Wilson was sandwiched between two presidents from the opposing party.

Then after Wilson, the next president was Warren G. Harding, the 29th. So the question is whether Taft and Harding were from opposing parties.\n\nTaft was a Republican, and Wilson was a Democrat. Then Harding was also a Republican. So Wilson was preceded by a Republican and followed by a Republican. So the two presidents around him were both from the opposing party (since Wilson was a Democrat). So that would mean yes, he was sandwiched between two Republicans, which are opposing parties. Therefore, the answer should be yes. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the order. Let me check again.\n\nYes, Taft (Republican) was president before Wilson (Democrat), then Harding (Republican) after. So both Taft and Harding were Republicans, opposing Wilson's party.

However, he was originally a Republican. Then William Howard Taft was also a Republican. Then Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat. So after Wilson, Harding was a Republican. So the presidents before and after Wilson were Taft (Republican) and Harding (Republican). Wait, that would mean both were from the same party. Wait, but the question says \"opposing party\".

Then Woodrow Wilson (28th) from 1913 to 1921. So before Wilson was Taft, who was a Republican, and after Wilson was Warren G. Harding (29th), who was also a Republican. Wait, no. Wait, after Wilson was Harding, right? So Wilson was president from 1913 to 1921. Then Harding was president from 1921 to 1923. So the president before Wilson was Taft (Republican), and the president after was Harding (Republican). So both Taft and Harding were from the opposing party to Wilson, who was a Democrat. Therefore, yes, Wilson was sandwiched between two presidents from the opposing party. Therefore, the answer should be true. Wait, but I need to check if Taft and Harding were indeed from opposing parties. Wilson was a Democrat. Taft was Republican, so that's opposing. Harding was also Republican.
