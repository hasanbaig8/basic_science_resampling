      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if a felony jury is enough people for a Bunco game. Hmm, first I need to understand what each term refers to.\n\nA felony jury is a group of jurors selected to decide the guilt of someone accused of a serious crime. In the US, a typical felony jury consists of 12 people. They have to reach a unanimous decision to convict, right? So that's a legal context.\n\nNow, Bunco is a game. From what I remember, Bunco is a social game that usually involves a group of players. The standard setup for Bunco requires a minimum number of players. Let me think. I believe Bunco is typically played with 6 to 12 people, divided into groups of 3 or 4. Each game involves a set of numbers, and players bet on the outcome. So, the number of people needed for a Bunco game depends on the number of players. But the question is whether a felony jury (which is 12 people) is enough. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"Is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So, if a felony jury has 12 people, and Bunco can be played with 6-12 players, then 12 would be sufficient. However, maybe the question is a play on words or a trick question. Let me check if there's any other meaning. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confusing \"jury\" with something else. But the term \"felony jury\" specifically refers to the legal group. So, if the game requires at least 6 players, then 12 people would be enough. But maybe the game requires more? Wait, no. The standard Bunco game is played with 6-12 players, so 12 is the maximum. So having 12 people would be sufficient. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But wait, maybe the question is a trick. For example, in Bunco, the number of players affects the number of rounds and the structure of the game. However, the minimum number of players is 6. So a group of 12 is more than enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the term \"jury\" as in a group of people, but the actual answer is that a felony jury (12 people) is enough for Bunco, which can be played with that number. So the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me verify the standard Bunco setup. \n\nAfter a quick check, Bunco is typically played with 6-12 players. So 12 people would be the upper limit. Therefore, a felony jury, which has 12 people, would be sufficient for a Bunco game. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But wait, the question is phrased as \"enough people for a Bunco game.\" If the game requires at least 6 players, then 12 is enough. So the answer is yes. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a felony jury is enough people for a Bunco game. Hmm, first I need to understand what each term refers to.\n\nA felony jury, in legal terms, is a group of jurors required for trying a felony case. The number varies by jurisdiction, but in the US, it's typically 12 people. Now, Bunco is a social game, right? It's usually played with a group of people, often in a party setting. The standard number of players for Bunco is usually around 6 to 12 people, but it can be more. However, the question is whether a felony jury (which is 12 people) is \"enough\" for a Bunco game.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"Is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So they're asking if the number of people in a felony jury (which is 12) is sufficient for playing Bunco. But Bunco games can be played with more or fewer people. However, the term \"enough\" here might be tricky. If the game requires a minimum number, say 6, then 12 would be enough. But maybe the question is a play on words. Wait, maybe there's a pun here. Because \"jury\" and \"Bunco\" might have some connection? Or maybe the question is a trick because a jury is a group of people selected for a legal trial, not for a game. So the answer would be no, because a felony jury isn't a group of people suitable for playing Bunco. But the question is about the number of people. Wait, the actual number of people in a felony jury is 12, and Bunco games can have 12 players. So technically, the number is enough. But maybe the question is trying to trick you into thinking about the purpose of a jury versus a game. But the question is strictly about the number. So the answer would be yes, because 12 is enough for Bunco. But wait, maybe the question is a trick because a jury is not a group of people who play games. But the question is phrased as \"enough people\", not \"appropriate people\". So if the question is just about the numerical sufficiency, then 12 is enough. But maybe the answer is no because a jury is not a group for playing Bunco. However, the question is a yes/no question, so the answer depends on whether the number is sufficient. Let me check the actual rules of Bunco. Bunco typically requires at least 6 players, but can have up to 12 or more. So 12 people would be enough. Therefore, the answer is yes. But wait, the question is phrased as \"a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So the answer would be yes, because 12 people is sufficient. But maybe the answer is no because a jury is not a group of people who play games. But the question is about the number, not the purpose. So the answer is yes.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a felony jury is enough people for a Bunco game. Hmm, first I need to recall what a felony jury consists of. From what I remember, in the United States, a felony jury typically requires 12 people. They're responsible for determining the guilt of the defendant in a serious crime.\n\nNow, Bunco is a social game, right? It's usually played with a group of people, often in a party setting. The standard number of players can vary, but typically, Bunco games require at least four people to play. Some sources mention that the game can be played with as few as four players, but it's more enjoyable with more people. However, the exact number might depend on the specific rules being used.\n\nSo, the question is whether a felony jury (which is 12 people) is enough for a Bunco game. Well, 12 people is more than the minimum required for Bunco. But wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The term \"felony jury\" refers to the legal process, not the number of people. The question might be playing on the word \"jury\" versus the game \"Bunco.\" But assuming the question is straightforward, the answer would be based on numbers.\n\nBut wait, maybe the question is a trick question. Because a felony jury is a legal term, and Bunco is a game. So the actual number of people in a felony jury (12) is more than enough for a Bunco game, which can have 4 or more players. So the answer would be yes. But I need to make sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"Is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So the \"enough people\" part. Since a Bunco game requires at least 4 players, and a felony jury has 12, then yes, 12 people would be enough. But maybe the question is trying to confuse the terms. Like, maybe a \"jury\" in the game Bunco? But I don't think so. The term \"jury\" in Bunco isn't a standard term. So the answer is that a felony jury (12 people) is sufficient for a Bunco game, which needs at least 4 players. So the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure that the question isn't using \"jury\" in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the question is a play on words, but I think the answer is that 12 people are enough for Bunco. So the decision would be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

From what I remember, Bunco is a dice game played with a group of people. The standard number of players can vary, but it's usually played with 6 to 12 people, sometimes in groups of 6. Each player is in a group, and they take turns rolling dice. The goal is to get certain combinations. \n\nSo the question is comparing the number of people in a felony jury (which is 12) to the number needed for Bunco. But wait, the user might be mixing up terms. A \"felony jury\" isn't a group of people but a legal term. However, if we take the number of jurors in a felony case (which is 12) and compare it to the number required for Bunco, maybe the user is asking if 12 people are sufficient for a Bunco game. \n\nBut Bunco games can be played with fewer people. For example, if there are 6 players, that's a standard setup. However, if the group is larger, say 12, that's also possible. But the question is phrased as \"Is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So the answer would depend on whether the number of jurors (12) is sufficient. Since Bunco can be played with 6 or more players, 12 would be enough. But wait, maybe the user is confused between the terms. A \"felony jury\" isn't a group of people but a legal term. So maybe the user is asking if the concept of a jury (as in a group of people) is sufficient for Bunco. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a \"jury\" as a group of people, and asking if that group's size (12) is enough for Bunco. But Bunco requires a certain number of players. If the group is 12, that's acceptable. However, the question is phrased as \"a felony jury\" which is a specific legal term, not a group of people. So perhaps the answer is no, because a felony jury isn't a group of people but a legal entity. \n\nWait, but the user might be using \"felony jury\" to mean the number of jurors (12). So if the question is whether 12 people (as in a felony jury) are enough for a Bunco game, then the answer would be yes, because Bunco can be played with 6 or more players. But if the question is whether a felony jury (as a legal proceeding) is sufficient for Bunco, then the answer is no. \n\nThe phrasing is a bit ambiguous. However, since the user is asking about \"enough people,\" it's likely referring to the number. So if a felony jury has 12 people, and Bunco can be played with 6 or more, then 12 is enough. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I need to make sure. \n\nWait, maybe the user is confused between \"jury\" and \"players.\" Let me check the standard Bunco setup. According to the rules, Bunco is played with 6 players, each in a group of 6. However, it can be played with more players. So if you have 12 people, you could split them into two groups of 6, which would work. Therefore, 12 people (as in a felony jury) would be sufficient. \n\nBut the answer is a yes/no question. So the answer would be yes. However, I need to make sure that the user isn't using \"felony jury\" as a group of people. But in reality, a felony jury is a group of 12 jurors. So the answer would be yes, because 12 is enough for Bunco. \n\nBut wait, the answer might be no because Bunco requires a specific number of players. Wait, no, Bunco can be played with more than 6. So 12 people would be acceptable. Therefore, the answer is yes. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick. Because a felony jury is not a group of people, but a legal term. So the answer would be no, because a felony jury isn't a group of people. But the user might be using \"felony jury\" to refer to the number of people (12). \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, given the way the question is phrased, the user is likely asking if the number of people in a felony jury (which is 12) is sufficient for a Bunco game. Therefore, the answer would be yes, because 12 is more than enough. \n\nBut I need to be cautious. Maybe the user is confused between \"jury\" and \"players.\" So the correct answer would be no, because a jury is not a group of people for a game. But that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because a Bunco game requires a specific number of players, and a felony jury's size (12) is not the same as the required number. But since Bunco can be played with 12 players, the answer would be yes. \n\nI think the answer is yes. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

However, the question is whether a felony jury (which is 12 people) is \"enough\" for a Bunco game. \n\nWait, but the question might be a bit of a trick. Because a felony jury is a group of people serving a legal purpose, while Bunco is a game. So the number of people in a jury (12) is the same as the maximum number of players for Bunco. But does that mean it's enough? Well, Bunco can be played with fewer people. For example, the minimum number might be 6. So if the jury is 12, that's more than enough. But the question is phrased as \"enough people\"\u2014so if you need at least X people for Bunco, and a felony jury has 12, which is sufficient. \n\nBut maybe the user is confused about the terms. Like, could there be a misunderstanding between \"jury\" and \"group of people\"? For example, if someone thinks that a felony jury is a specific number of people for the game, but that's not the case. So the answer would be yes, because 12 people (the size of a felony jury) is enough for a Bunco game. However, if the question is implying that a felony jury is a group that's used for Bunco, then the answer would be no. But the question is asking if the number of people in a felony jury is sufficient for Bunco. \n\nSo, assuming that the question is asking about the numerical sufficiency, then yes, 12 people would be enough. But maybe the user is trying to trick me into mixing up the terms. But logically, the answer should be yes. Wait, but maybe the answer is no because a jury is not a group of people for a game. But the question is about the number of people. So the answer would be yes, because 12 is enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a play on words.

Each round, players bet on numbers, and there are different rounds. But the exact number needed for a game... I think the standard is 6 players, but you can have more. However, the question is about whether a felony jury (which is 12 people) is enough for Bunco. \n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"enough people for a Bunco game.\" So if Bunco requires at least 6 players, then 12 people would definitely be enough. But maybe the user is confusing the term \"jury\" with something else? Or maybe there's a play on words here. Let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a scenario where a felony jury is not enough? For example, if Bunco requires more than 12 players? But I don't think that's the case. The game can be played with 6 or more, so 12 would be sufficient. Therefore, the answer should be yes. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is mixing up \"jury\" with something else. Let me confirm the number for Bunco. A quick recall: Bunco is typically played with 6-12 players, with each player in a group of 6. But if there are 12 players, they might split into two groups. So 12 people would work. So a felony jury of 12 would be enough. Therefore, the answer should be true. \n\nBut maybe the question is a trick question? Like, a jury is not a group of people for a game. But the question is phrased as \"enough people,\" so maybe it's just checking the number. So the answer is yes, because 12 is more than the minimum required for Bunco. So the decision is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if a felony jury is enough people for a Bunco game. Hmm, first I need to understand both terms.\n\nA felony jury refers to a jury involved in a serious criminal case, typically requiring a certain number of jurors. In the US, for example, a felony trial usually has a jury of 12 people. But maybe the question is more about the number of people required for a Bunco game.\n\nBunco is a dice game, right? I think the standard number of players for Bunco is usually 10 or more, but maybe it can be played with fewer. Wait, let me recall. The game is often played in groups where each player has a target number. The number of people needed might depend on the specific rules being used. Some variations might require a minimum of 6 players, but I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, the question is whether a felony jury (which is 12 people) is \"enough\" for Bunco. So if Bunco requires, say, 6 players, then 12 would be enough. But if Bunco needs more than 12, then it's not. But I think the standard Bunco game can be played with as few as 6 players. So 12 people would definitely be enough. However, maybe the question is a trick. Like, maybe the term \"felony jury\" refers to the number of people, but the actual game requires a different number. Alternatively, maybe there's a play on words here.

I think Bunco is a social game that usually involves a group of people. Let me think about how many people are needed to play Bunco. I remember that Bunco is played with a group, and each round involves different numbers of players. But the minimum number of players required for the game... Wait, Bunco is often played with 6 to 12 people, but the exact number might vary. However, the game is structured so that each player is part of a group, and the game is played in rounds. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether a felony jury (which is 12 people) is enough for a Bunco game. So if Bunco requires at least 6 players, then 12 would be sufficient. But maybe the question is a bit of a trick. Wait, maybe the question is mixing up terms. A felony jury is a group of people who serve on a jury for a felony trial, which is a legal process. Bunco is a game, so the two are unrelated. \n\nBut the question is asking if the number of people in a felony jury (which is 12) is enough for a Bunco game.

So if you have a jury of 12, that's exactly the number needed. Therefore, a felony jury (which is 12 people) would be sufficient for a Bunco game. However, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The term \"Bunco\" could be confused with \"Bunco\" as in a type of game, but I think the answer hinges on the number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick because a jury is not a group of players for a game. But the question is about the number of people. So if the game requires at least 6 people, then 12 is enough. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the question is not about the number of players but about the structure. For example, a Bunco game might require specific roles or numbers.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a felony jury is enough people for a Bunco game.

Like, a felony jury is a group of people, but Bunco is a game that requires a certain number of players. If the number of people in a felony jury is sufficient (i.e., 12), then maybe the answer is yes. But I need to check if the standard Bunco game requires 12 players. \n\nWait, looking it up in my mind, Bunco is usually played with 6 to 12 players, divided into groups of 3 or 4. So if a felony jury has 12 people, that would be enough. But maybe the question is a play on words. However, the answer would be based on the number. Since 12 is the standard for a felony jury, and Bunco can be played with 12, then the answer would be yes. But I'm not 100% sure.

But I think the answer is no, because the question is a trick. Wait, no. The question is asking if a felony jury is enough people. So if the jury has 12 people, and Bunco can be played with 12, then yes. But maybe the answer is no because a jury is not a group of people for a game. But the question is about the number of people. So the answer would be yes if the number of people in a felony jury (12) is sufficient for Bunco. Since Bunco can be played with 12, the answer is yes. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, like a jury is not a group for a game. But the answer depends on the number. So I think the answer is yes, but I need to confirm. Wait, I think Bunco is played with 6-12 players, so 12 is enough. Therefore, the answer is yes. But maybe the answer is no because the term \"jury\" is not related to the game.

Hmm, first I need to understand what each term refers to.\n\nA felony jury, in legal terms, is a group of jurors selected to try a felony case. The number required varies by jurisdiction, but typically in the United States, it's 12 jurors. They have to reach a unanimous verdict, or sometimes a majority, depending on the state.\n\nNow, Bunco is a social game, usually played with a group of people. The standard number of players for Bunco is usually around 6 to 12 people, but it can vary. The game is played in rounds, and each round involves a group of players. However, the exact number needed for a game isn't fixed, but you need at least a few people to play. \n\nSo the question is comparing the number of people in a felony jury (which is 12) to the number needed for a Bunco game. If a felony jury has 12 people, then that's more than enough for a Bunco game, which can be played with as few as 6. But wait, the question is phrased as \"is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So if the jury has 12 people, that's more than the minimum required for Bunco. However, maybe the question is a play on words. \"Enough people\" might mean that the number is sufficient. So if a felony jury has 12, which is more than the minimum for Bunco, then yes, it's enough. But wait, maybe the question is a trick. Because a jury is a group of people selected for a legal purpose, not a game. So maybe the answer is no, because a felony jury isn't a group of people for a game. But the question is phrased as \"is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So maybe it's a literal question. If a felony jury has 12 people, then that's enough for Bunco. But maybe the answer is no because the jury isn't a group of people for a game. Wait, but the question is about the number of people. So if the jury has 12 people, which is a sufficient number for a Bunco game (since you can have 12 players), then the answer would be yes. But maybe the answer is no because the context of a jury is not related to a game. However, the question is asking about the number of people, not the purpose. So the answer would be yes. But I need to check if a felony jury is indeed 12 people. Let me confirm: in the US, a felony jury is 12 people, yes. So 12 people is enough for a Bunco game. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But wait, maybe the question is a trick because Bunco is a game that requires a certain number of players, but the actual answer is that the number of people in a jury isn't related to the game. But the question is phrased as \"enough people\" so if the number is sufficient, then yes. So I think the answer is yes. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The question is whether a felony jury (as in the group of people) is enough people for Bunco. So if the jury has 12 people, then that's more than enough for Bunco. So the answer is yes. But I'm not sure if the question is trying to trick me. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because a jury is not a group of people for a game, but the question is about the number. So the answer would be yes. So the final answer should be {\"decision\": true} because 12 people are enough for Bunco.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a felony jury is enough people for a Bunco game. Hmm. First, I need to recall what a felony jury consists of. From what I remember, in the United States, a felony jury typically requires 12 people. They are selected through a jury pool and are responsible for determining the guilt of a defendant in a serious crime.\n\nNow, Bunco is a social game, right? It's usually played with a group of people, often in a party or gathering. The standard number of players for Bunco can vary, but typically, it's played with 6 to 12 people. Each round involves different numbers of players, and the game is structured around making bets and scoring points based on dice rolls.\n\nSo, the question is comparing the size of a felony jury (which is 12 people) to the required number for a Bunco game. If Bunco can be played with as few as 6 people, then a group of 12 (like a felony jury) would definitely be enough. However, if the question is implying that the jury size is the exact number needed for Bunco, then maybe not. But I think the key here is that Bunco doesn't require a specific number of people beyond a minimum. So, having 12 people would be more than enough. Therefore, the answer would be yes, a felony jury (which has 12 people) is enough for a Bunco game. Wait, but maybe the question is trying to trick me? Like, is there a specific number required for Bunco? Let me double-check. \n\nLooking up Bunco rules quickly: Bunco is typically played with 6-12 players, divided into groups of 3. So, 12 players would be perfect. So, a felony jury of 12 would be sufficient. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But wait, the question is phrased as \"Is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So, if the jury is 12 people, and Bunco can be played with 12, then yes. So the answer is true.

In the US legal system, a felony trial usually requires a jury of 12 people. But Bunco is a social game, right? Let me recall the rules of Bunco. From what I remember, Bunco is a dice game played with a group of people. The standard number of players can vary, but it's usually played with 6 to 12 people, sometimes in groups of 6.

But if the question is whether a felony jury (as a legal proceeding) is sufficient for Bunco, then the answer is no. \n\nThe phrasing is a bit ambiguous.

But does that mean it's enough? Well, Bunco can be played with fewer people. For example, the minimum number might be 6. So if the jury is 12, that's more than enough. But the question is phrased as \"enough people\"\u2014so if you need at least X people for Bunco, and a felony jury has 12, which is sufficient. \n\nBut maybe the user is confused about the terms. Like, could there be a misunderstanding between \"jury\" and \"group of people\"? For example, if someone thinks that a felony jury is a specific number of people for the game, but that's not the case. So the answer would be yes, because 12 people (the size of a felony jury) is enough for a Bunco game. However, if the question is implying that a felony jury is a group that's used for Bunco, then the answer would be no. But the question is asking if the number of people in a felony jury is sufficient for Bunco. \n\nSo, assuming that the question is asking about the numerical sufficiency, then yes, 12 people would be enough. But maybe the user is trying to trick me into mixing up the terms. But logically, the answer should be yes. Wait, but maybe the answer is no because a jury is not a group of people for a game.

So 12 people would be sufficient. However, maybe the answer is no because the term \"felony jury\" refers to the legal process, not the number of people. Wait, but the question is about the number of people. So if a felony jury is 12 people, then that's the same as the number needed for Bunco. But maybe the question is a trick because Bunco is a game that requires a specific setup, like a group of people, but the actual number of people required might be different. Wait, maybe the answer is yes because 12 people would be enough. But I need to confirm. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confused between \"Bunco\" as a game and \"Bunco\" as a term for something else. Wait, but Bunco is a game. So, if the question is whether a group of 12 (a felony jury) is enough for a Bunco game, then yes, because 12 is the standard number. However, maybe the answer is no because the question is a play on words. Wait, but the question is straightforward. The user is asking if the number of people in a felony jury is sufficient for the game. So, if the game requires 6 or more players, then 12 would be enough. Therefore, the answer would be yes.

      "<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a felony jury is enough people for a Bunco game. Hmm, first I need to understand what each term refers to.\n\nA felony jury, in legal terms, typically refers to a jury involved in trying a felony case. The number of jurors varies by jurisdiction, but in the United States, it's usually 12 people. However, sometimes there might be alternate jurors, so the total could be more. But the main number is 12.\n\nNow, Bunco is a social game, right? It's a dice game played in groups. The standard number of players for Bunco isn't fixed, but it's usually played with a group of people, often in multiples of 6 or 8. But the exact number can vary. However, the question is about whether a felony jury (which is 12 people) is enough for a Bunco game. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"Is a felony jury enough people for a Bunco game?\" So it's asking if the number of people in a felony jury (which is 12) is sufficient for playing Bunco. \n\nBut Bunco games can be played with different numbers. For example, if you have a group of 12 people, that's more than enough. But maybe the question is a play on words? Like, maybe \"felony jury\" refers to something else? Or is there a specific number required for Bunco?\n\nWait, maybe I should check if Bunco requires a specific number of players. From what I recall, Bunco is typically played with a group of 6 or more players, often in groups of 6 or 8. However, the game can be played with as few as 2 players, though that might not be optimal. So if a felony jury has 12 people, that's more than enough for Bunco. \n\nBut maybe the question is trying to trick me. Like, maybe \"felony jury\" is a term that's being used differently here? Or perhaps there's a pun on \"jury\" and \"Bunco\" (like a \"jury\" as in a group of people). But that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is mixing up \"jury\" with \"joker\" or something else. But I don't think so. \n\nSo, the key points: A felony jury has 12 jurors. Bunco can be played with 6 or more players. Therefore, 12 people would be sufficient. So the answer would be yes. But wait, the qu\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

From what I know, in the United States, a felony jury typically requires 12 jurors. That's the standard for serious crimes. \n\nNow, Bunco is a social game, right? It's usually played with a group of people, often in a party setting. The standard number of players for Bunco can vary, but I think it's typically played with 6 to 8 people. Each round, players bet on numbers, and there are specific rules about how many people are needed to play. \n\nWait, but the question is comparing the number of people in a felony jury to the number needed for Bunco. So if a felony jury has 12 people, does that mean 12 is enough for Bunco? But Bunco games usually require fewer players. For example, a standard game might need at least 6 players. So 12 people would definitely be enough, but maybe the question is more about whether the number is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The user might be mixing up terms. A felony jury is a legal term, while Bunco is a game. The question is whether the number of people in a felony jury (which is 12) is enough for a Bunco game. Since Bunco can be played with more than 6 people, 12 would be sufficient. But maybe the actual answer is no because the context is different. Wait, no, the question is straightforward: is the number of people in a felony jury enough for a Bunco game? So if Bunco requires, say, 6 players, then 12 would be enough. But maybe the question is a trick, like whether the jury is the right group of people for Bunco, but that's not what's being asked. The question is about the number of people. \n\nSo, the answer would be yes, because 12 is more than enough for Bunco. However, I should verify the standard number of players for Bunco. Let me think. Bunco is usually played with 6 or more players, but the exact number can vary. For example, some sources say that you need at least 6 players for the game to work properly.
