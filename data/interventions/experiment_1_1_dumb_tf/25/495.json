      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking whether the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. A baker's dozen is 13, right? So the question is whether the Gracie founders had 13 or more children in total.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu are. The Gracie family is well-known, especially the brothers Carlos, Helio, and Rickson Gracie. Wait, but the original founders are often considered to be the Gracie brothers, including Carlos, Helio, and maybe others. However, the main ones are Carlos and Helio, who were the ones who popularized BJJ in the 20th century. But I think there were more family members involved. \n\nNow, the key here is to find out how many children the founders had. The term \"Gracie founders\" might refer to the core family members who started the practice. Let me think. The Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. The main founders are often considered to be the original Gracie brothers, but the family had many offspring. \n\nI remember that Carlos Gracie had several children. His son Royce Gracie became famous in the UFC. Then there's Helio Gracie, who developed the Gracie fighting system. Helio also had children. The Gracie family is known for having a large number of children, so maybe the total number of kids from the founders is over 13. \n\nWait, but the question is about \"at least a baker's dozen\" which is 13. So if the total number of children from the founders is 13 or more, the answer is yes. Let me check some numbers. \n\nCarlos Gracie had 12 children, I think. Helio Gracie had 7 children. But wait, there's also the other brothers, like Rickson, who might have had children as well. Wait, but maybe the founders are only Carlos and Helio. If Carlos had 12 kids and Helio had 7, that would be 19, which is way over 13. But maybe the question is about the founders as a group. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the founders include other family members. Wait, but the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. However, I need to confirm the exact number. Let me think again. Carlos Gracie had 12 children, including Royce, and Helio had 7. But if the founders are considered as the main ones, maybe Carlos and Helio, then their combined children would be 12 + 7 = 19, which is more than 13. So the answer would be yes. \n\nBut wait, maybe the founders are only the original brothers, like Carlos and Helio. If that's the case, then their kids would be 12 (Carlos) + 7 (Helio) = 19, which is more than 13. So the answer is yes. But I need to make sure that the question is referring to the founders as a group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the entire Gracie family, not just the founders. But the question specifically says \"Gracie founders,\" so it's about the founders. \n\nWait, but some sources might say that the founders are the original Gracie brothers, which might include more than just Carlos and Helio. For example, there's also the other brothers like the original Gracie brothers who started the practice. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Gracie family as a whole had more than 13 children. Let me think. If Carlos had 12 children and Helio had 7, that's 19, which is more than 13. So the answer would be yes. But I need to verify if that's accurate. \n\nWait, I might be mixing up the numbers. Let me try to recall. Carlos Gracie had 12 children, and Helio Gracie had 7. So together, that's 19 children. That's definitely more than 13. Therefore, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut maybe the question is referring to the founders as a group, and the founders are considered as a group of people, not just Carlos and Helio. For example, if there were more founders, like other brothers, then their children would add up. However, the main founders are usually considered to be Carlos and Helio. \n\nSo, given that, the answer would be yes, because even if it's just Carlos and Helio, they had 19 children combined. Therefore, the answer is true. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. First, I need to recall who the Gracie founders are. The Gracie family is most famously known for their role in popularizing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, especially through the Gracie family's contributions and the Gracie Challenge.\n\nThe main founders are the Gracie brothers. The most well-known ones are Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie. Helio was the brother who adapted the martial art into Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and Carlos was the original practitioner. However, the Gracie family is quite large, so there are more siblings. Let me think: the Gracie family includes several brothers. Let me count them. Carlos, Helio, Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and maybe others. Wait, how many brothers are there exactly?\n\nI think there are five main brothers: Carlos, Helio, Rickson, Rorion, and Royce. That's five. But wait, some sources might mention more. Let me check my memory. The Gracie family is known for having several brothers who all practiced and promoted BJJ. However, the exact number might vary. But the question is about the founders. The original founders are typically considered Carlos and Helio, but the family as a whole contributed. \n\nNow, the question is about the number of kids between them. So, if they had children, how many in total? Wait, the question is whether the founders (the Gracie family) had at least a baker's dozen of kids. A baker's dozen is 13. So, the total number of children among the founders (the brothers) should be at least 13.\n\nBut wait, the Gracie brothers are the ones who founded BJJ. But are they all considered founders? Or just Carlos and Helio? Let me clarify. The Gracie family, including Carlos, Helio, Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and others, all contributed to the development and promotion of BJJ. However, the primary founders are usually Carlos and Helio. But the question might be referring to the entire Gracie family that was involved in the development. \n\nNow, the key is to find out how many children the Gracie founders had. Wait, the question is about the founders having at least 13 kids between them. So, if the founders are the Gracie brothers, how many children do they have in total?\n\nWait, but the Gracie family is known for having several children. Let me think. Carlos Gracie had children, as did Helio. But how many total? For example, Carlos had a son named Rickson, who is a prominent figure. Helio had children like Rorion and Royce. But maybe there are more. Let me try to recall. The Gracie family's children include:\n\n- Carlos Gracie Jr. (Rickson Gracie)\n- Rorion Gracie\n- Royce Gracie\n- Also, there's the case of the Gracie family's children. Wait, the Gracie family has several brothers, but the number of children might be different. For example, Carlos Gracie had a son named Rickson, and Helio had Rorion and Royce. However, the exact number of children the founders (the brothers) have might be more than 13. Wait, but the question is about the founders. If the founders are the entire Gracie family that contributed, then the total number of children might be more than 13. \n\nAlternatively, if the founders are only Carlos and Helio, then how many children do they have? Carlos had at least Rickson. Helio had Rorion and Royce. But that's three children. That's way less than 13. However, the Gracie family is a large family, and the question might be referring to all the Gracie brothers. Wait, the Gracie family is known for having multiple brothers who were all practitioners of BJJ. So the founders are the brothers. But the question is about the number of kids between them. So, if the founders are the brothers, then the total number of children they have would be the sum of their children. \n\nWait, but this is getting confusing. Let me think again. The question is about the Gracie founders (the people who started Brazilian jiu-jitsu) having at least 13 kids between them. The Gracie family is known for having several brothers, but the number of children they have in total. For example, the Gracie family's children include Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and others. But how many total children do the founders have?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of children in the Gracie family. The Gracie family has multiple generations. The original founders (Carlos and Helio) had children. Let's check. Carlos Gracie had a son, Rickson, and a daughter, perhaps? Wait, I'm not sure. Helio Gracie had Rorion and Royce. But the exact number of children from the founders (the original Gracie brothers) is unclear. \n\nWait, the Gracie family is quite large. Let me try to find the count. For example, the Gracie family is known for having several brothers. The main ones are Carlos, Helio, Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and maybe others. However, the question is about the founders, not the entire family. The founders are typically considered to be Carlos and Helio. But if we consider all the brothers who contributed to the development of BJJ, then the number of children might be more. \n\nBut the question is about the founders having at least 13 kids between them. So, if the founders are the Gracie brothers, how many children do they have in total? For example, if there are five brothers, each having a certain number of children, the total might be more than 13. However, without exact numbers, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no. Because the Gracie family is known for having several brothers, but the number of children may not reach 13. For example, if the founders are Carlos and Helio, they may have only a few children. But if the question is referring to all the Gracie family members who were founders, then maybe there are more. \n\nWait, I think the key here is that a baker's dozen is 13. The Gracie family is known to have multiple children, but I'm not sure if they had at least 13. Let me think of some sources. From what I remember, the Gracie family has several children. For instance, Carlos Gracie had Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and others. Helio had Rorion and Royce, but maybe others. Wait, but if the founders are the entire Gracie family, then the total number of children might be more than 13. However, I need to be precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is false. Because if the founders are the Gracie brothers, and they have a total of 13 children between them, that would be the case. But I'm not sure. Let me think of the number again. For example, the Gracie family's children include Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and others. However, if the founders are the brothers, then the total number of children they have would be more than 13? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is no. Because the Gracie family's children are not that numerous. For example, if there are 5 brothers, and each has 2 children, that's 10. But if some have more, maybe reaching 13. \n\nBut without exact numbers, it's challenging. However, I recall that the Gracie family is known for having several children, but the exact count might be less than 13. Therefore, the answer might be no. Alternatively, if the founders are considered as the entire family, maybe they have more. \n\nWait, another approach: the question is about the founders (the Gracie family) having at least 13 kids between them. So, if the Gracie family has more than 13 children, then the answer is yes. But if not, then no. \n\nI think the correct answer is no. The Gracie family, while large, does not have 13 children. For example, the main Gracie brothers are Carlos, Helio, Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and possibly others. But the number of children they have is not 13. For instance, if Carlos had two kids, Helio had two, and others had some, maybe the total is less than 13. Therefore, the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Now, I need to verify the number of children the main founders had. The primary founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Helio and Carlos Gracie, who are often credited with developing the system. However, the Gracie family is a large one, and there are multiple generations involved.\n\nLet me think. The Gracie family has several generations, and the original founders might include Helio, Carlos, and possibly their siblings. Helio Gracie had several children, including Rickson, Royce, and others. Carlos Gracie also had children. But I need to check how many children the founders had in total. \n\nWait, the question says \"between them,\" so it's the total number of children from all the founders. Let me recall. The Gracie family is known for having many children. Helio Gracie had at least 10 children, and Carlos Gracie had several as well. If we add them up, maybe they have more than 13. For example, Helio's children include Rickson, Royce, Marcus, and others. Carlos had children like Carlos Jr., and others. However, if the founders include other family members, maybe the total is higher. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the founders. The main founders are Helio and Carlos. Let me check their children. Helio had at least 10 kids, and Carlos had around 5. That would total 15, which is more than 13. So that would mean the answer is yes. But I need to be precise. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the original Gracie family that started the system. The Gracie family is a large family, and they have many children. The Gracie family's website or biographies might list the number of children. For example, Helio Gracie had 10 children, and Carlos Gracie had 5. So combined, that's 15.

The most well-known ones are Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie, but there were others in the family. The Gracie family is known for their contributions to BJJ, and they have a large family.\n\nA baker's dozen is 13.

      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. Let me start by recalling what a baker's dozen is. A baker's dozen refers to 13 items, right? So the question is asking if the Gracie founders had 13 or more children in total.\n\nFirst, I should confirm who the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu are. The Gracie family is well-known for their contributions to the sport. The main founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie. However, there's also mention of other family members like Rickson, Rorion, and others. But the primary founders are usually considered Helio and Carlos, along with their brothers.\n\nNow, I need to check how many children the Gracie founders had. Let me think. Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie were brothers. Helio had several children, including Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and others. Carlos also had children. But I need to count all the children of the founders. Wait, the question says \"between them,\" so it's the total number of children that all the founders had combined.\n\nLet me try to list them. Helio Gracie's children: Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and maybe others. Carlos Gracie's children: I think he had a daughter named Claudia, and perhaps others. Also, there's the possibility that other founders, like the original founders, might have other children. But I'm not sure if there were more founders beyond Helio and Carlos. Some sources mention that the Gracie family includes several generations, but the original founders are Helio and Carlos.\n\nWait, Helio and Carlos were the main founders. Let me check the exact number. Helio had at least three sons: Rickson, Rorion, and Royce. Then there's also Carlos's children. Carlos had a daughter, Claudia Gracie, and maybe others. Let me think. Carlos Gracie Jr. had a daughter named Claudia, and then there's also the possibility of other children. But I might be mixing up the generations here. \n\nWait, Helio had several children, including Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and maybe others. Carlos had a daughter, Claudia, and perhaps another child. If we count all the children of Helio and Carlos, that would be Rickson, Rorion, Royce (from Helio) and Claudia (from Carlos). That's four children. But maybe there are more. For example, Helio's other children, like his son Carlos? Wait, Carlos was one of the founders, so maybe he's not counted as a child of Helio? Wait, Helio and Carlos are brothers, so they are siblings, not father and son. So Helio's children are Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and maybe others. Carlos's children would be Claudia, and perhaps others. \n\nWait, I think there are more children. For instance, the Gracie family has several members, including the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu academy, which has multiple generations. But the founders themselves, Helio and Carlos, may have had more children. Let me try to recall. Helio had three sons: Rickson, Rorion, and Royce. Carlos had a daughter, Claudia, and another son, Carlos Gracie Jr. (maybe?), but I'm not sure. Wait, Carlos Gracie Jr. is actually a son of Carlos Gracie, right? So if Carlos had a son, that would add another child. So if Helio had three sons and Carlos had two children (a son and a daughter), that would total five. But I think there are more. For example, the Gracie family has a lot of children. \n\nWait, let me check. Helio had at least four children: Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and another son named Marcelo. Wait, Marcelo Gracie is another brother? Or is he a cousin? Maybe I'm confusing the family tree. Alternatively, perhaps the founders (Helio and Carlos) had more than four children. If we count all of them, maybe there are more than 13? Wait, the question is about the founders, not the entire family. So if the founders are Helio and Carlos, then their children would be their sons and daughters. But I need to confirm the exact number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the founders include other family members. For example, some sources mention that the Gracie family includes several generations, but the main founders are the original brothers. However, if the question refers to all founders, maybe including other brothers like Oswaldo or others. Let me think. The Gracie family has several brothers, including Helio, Carlos, Alberto, and others. So if all of them are considered founders, then their children would be more. \n\nBut I think the primary founders are Helio and Carlos. Let's stick to them for now. Helio had three sons: Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and maybe another. Carlos had a daughter Claudia and a son Carlos Jr. That would be five children. But that's not a baker's dozen. However, maybe there are more children. For example, Helio's family might have had more children. Wait, I think Helio had at least four sons: Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and another son named Marcelo. So that's four. Carlos had a daughter Claudia and a son Carlos Jr. So that's two. Total of six children. Still not 13. \n\nBut wait, maybe the question includes all the Gracie family members who were involved in founding the art, not just the immediate founders. For example, the Gracie family includes several generations, but perhaps the founders include multiple brothers. If the founders are all the Gracie brothers who were involved in the creation of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, then maybe there are more children. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me try to look up the number of children. Wait, since I can't access external sources, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. Helio Gracie had four sons: Rickson, Rorion, Royce, and Marcelo. Carlos Gracie had a daughter, Claudia, and a son, Carlos Jr. Then there's also the possibility that Carlos had another child. If that's the case, then total children would be 4 (from Helio) + 2 (from Carlos) = 6. That's not even close to 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the entire Gracie family, not just the founders. But the question specifically says \"Gracie founders.\" So if the founders are Helio and Carlos, then their children would be the ones mentioned. If there are more founders, like other brothers, then their children would add to the total. \n\nWait, the original founders are considered to be the Gracie brothers, including Helio, Carlos, Alberto, and others. For example, the Gracie family includes multiple brothers. If all of them are considered founders, then their children would be more. Let me think. If Helio, Carlos, and Alberto are founders, then their children would be the ones from each. Suppose Helio has four children, Carlos has two, and Alberto has, say, two. That would be 8. Still not 13. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing some. For example, Helio had four sons, Carlos had two, and Alberto had three, and others. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the founders include more people, and their children add up. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is false because the total number of children of the founders is less than 13. However, I need to be precise. Let me think again. The Gracie family is known for having many children, but the founders themselves (Helio and Carlos) may not have that many. \n\nWait, if the founders are the entire Gracie family involved in the creation of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, then perhaps their children are more. But again, without exact numbers, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"baker's dozen\" is being used here as a trick. A baker's dozen is 13, so if the founders had at least 13 children between them, the answer is yes. But based on what I know, the founders (Helio and Carlos) had a total of around 6-8 children. Therefore, the answer would be false. \n\nBut I'm not 100% certain. Maybe there are more children. For example, if Helio had four sons and Carlos had three, that's seven. Still not 13. So unless there are other founders with children, the answer would be false. Therefore, the answer is no, they didn't have at least a baker's dozen (13) of kids between them. So the decision would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

But the question is about the founders, so maybe it includes other family members too.\n\nA baker's dozen is 13. So the question is whether the combined number of children from the Gracie founders is at least 13. Now, I need to check how many children the main founders had. \n\nHelio Gracie had several children. From what I remember, he had a daughter named Anna, and perhaps others. But I'm not sure about the exact number. Carlos Gracie, his brother, also had children. There's also the mention of other Gracie family members who contributed to the development of BJJ, like Rickson, Royce, and others. \n\nWait, the Gracie family is quite large. Let me think. Helio and Carlos were the main founders, but there are other brothers as well. The Gracie family has a lot of children. For example, Carlos Gracie Jr. had several kids. But the question is about the founders. If the founders include multiple generations, maybe the total number of children across all founders is more than 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to the original founders, like Helio and Carlos. Let me check. Helio had a daughter, Anna, and Carlos had a son, Carlos Jr., and others. But I think the Gracie family has more than 13 children in total. For instance, the Gracie family is known for having many children, and some sources mention that they have over 20 children. If that's the case, then the total number of kids between the founders would be more than 13, making the answer \"yes.\" \n\nBut wait, the question says \"between them,\" which could mean the total number of children from all the founders. If the founders include multiple family members, like the original brothers and their siblings, then the count would be higher. However, I need to verify the exact number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the original founders, like the original Gracie brothers who started the academy. If the original founders were Helio and Carlos, and they had a certain number of children each, but maybe not enough to reach 13. For example, if Helio had 3 kids and Carlos had 4, that's 7, which is less than 13. But if the founders include other family members, like their siblings or other generations, the total might be higher. \n\nWait, the Gracie family is known for having many children. For example, the Gracie family has over 20 children, according to some sources. So if the founders include multiple generations, the total number of kids would definitely be more than 13. Therefore, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I need to be careful here. The question is about the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The primary founders are the Gracie brothers, but the family as a whole has many children. So if the question is considering all the founders (which might be multiple people), then the total number of children would be more than 13. \n\nAlternatively, if the founders are considered as a group, like the original family members who started the practice, then the number of children might be more than 13. For example, if the Gracie family had 14 children, then the answer would be yes. \n\nAfter checking, I think the Gracie family has more than 13 children. For instance, Carlos Gracie had several children, and his brother Helio also had several. Plus, their cousins and other family members might have been involved. However, the exact number might be a bit tricky. But given that the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children, and a baker's dozen is 13, it's likely that the total is more than 13.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them.

The Gracie family is most famously known for their role in popularizing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, especially through the Gracie family's contributions and the Gracie challenge.\n\nNow, a baker's dozen refers to 13. So the question is whether the Gracie founders collectively had 13 or more children. Let me think about the Gracie family. The main founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Carlos, Helio, and others. But I need to check how many children they had in total.\n\nI remember that the Gracie family is large, and they had several children. The main ones include Carlos Gracie Jr., Helio Gracie, and others. However, the exact number might vary. Let me think: Carlos Gracie had several children.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking whether the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. A baker's dozen is 13, so we need to check if the Gracie founders had 13 or more children in total.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu are. The Gracie family is well-known for their role in developing and popularizing the martial art. The main founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie. However, there were other family members involved too, like Rickson Gracie, Rorion Gracie, and others. But the original founders are typically considered to be the brothers who started the Gracie Academy.\n\nNow, the key here is to determine how many children the founders had. The question says \"between them,\" so it's the total number of children from all the founders. Let me think about the Gracie family's children. Helio Gracie had several children, including Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, and others. Carlos Gracie also had children. However, I need to check if all these children are considered part of the founders or if the founders are only the immediate founders like Helio and Carlos.\n\nWait, the term \"founders\" might refer to the original group that started the Gracie Academy. The original founders were Helio, Carlos, and their brothers. But I'm not sure about the exact number of brothers. Let me think. Helio and Carlos were the main ones, but there were others. For example, the Gracie family had several brothers. Let me try to recall: Helio had several brothers, including Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, and others. But how many in total?\n\nIf the founders include Helio and Carlos, and maybe others, then the number of children would be the sum of their offspring. But I need to check how many children each founder had. For example, Helio had children like Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, and others. Carlos had children as well. But the question is about the founders, so if the founders are the ones who started the academy, maybe they are the immediate family members. However, the exact number of children is important here.\n\nLet me think of the Gracie family tree. Helio Gracie had several children. Let me list them: Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, Royce, and others. Wait, how many children did Helio have? I think he had at least four or five children. Carlos Gracie, being the older brother, had his own children. But the founders might be considered as Helio and Carlos, but perhaps others were also founders. For example, the Gracie family's original academy was started by Helio and Carlos, but there were other brothers involved as well. However, the key is to count the total number of children from the founders.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of children in the Gracie family who were involved in the founding. Let me check. The Gracie family is known for having many children. For example, Helio had several sons, including Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, and Royce. Carlos had children as well, such as Carlos Jr., and others. But if we count all the children from all the founders, how many would that be?\n\nIf we consider Helio and Carlos as the main founders, then their children would be Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, Royce, and others. Let's say Helio had at least 5 children. Carlos might have had 3 or 4. But the total might be around 8 or 9. However, if the founders include other family members, like the brothers who started the academy, perhaps there are more children.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the entire Gracie family. But the term \"founders\" might be more specific. Wait, the Gracie family had a lot of children. For example, the Gracie family is known for having 11 children, but I need to confirm that. If there are 11 children, then that's more than a baker's dozen (13). Wait, no, 11 is less than 13. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up numbers here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Gracie family had more than 13 children. Let me think again. The Gracie family is known for having several children. Helio had several sons, including Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, Royce, and maybe others. Carlos had children as well. Let's count. Helio's children: Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, Royce, and maybe others. Let's say 5. Carlos had, for example, Carlos Jr., and others. Let's say 3. That's 8. If other founders (like the brothers) had children, maybe that adds up. But if the founders are only Helio and Carlos, then the total number of children is 8. But maybe there are more founders. For example, the Gracie family had several brothers who were involved in the development of BJJ. If all of them are considered founders, then their children would be included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of children in the Gracie family, not just the founders. But the question specifically says \"Gracie founders,\" so it's about the founders, not the entire family. So if the founders are Helio and Carlos, and their brothers, then perhaps the total number of children is more than 13?\n\nWait, I think there's a common misconception here. The Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. For example, Helio had several children, and so did Carlos. Let me check some numbers. According to some sources, the Gracie family has had over 20 children, but that's the entire family. However, the founders might be a subset. For example, the original founders were Helio and Carlos. If they each had several children, maybe their total children would be more than 13.\n\nBut I need to be precise. Let me try to count. Helio Gracie had children: Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, Royce, and maybe others. Let's say that's 5. Carlos Gracie had children like Carlos Jr., and others. If Carlos had 3 children, that's 8. But if the founders include other brothers, like the ones who were part of the academy, perhaps more children are included. However, if the founders are only Helio and Carlos, then the total number of children would be around 8, which is less than 13. Therefore, the answer would be no.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the founders included more people. For example, the Gracie family had several brothers who were involved in BJJ. If all of them are considered founders, then their children would be counted. However, the term \"founders\" might refer to the original group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Gracie family had more than 13 children. Let me think again. If the question is asking about the founders (the original group), and they had a total of 13 or more children between them, then the answer would be yes. But I'm not certain. \n\nWait, I think there's a common fact that the Gracie family has had over 13 children. For example, Helio had at least 5, Carlos had 3, and others might have contributed. So if the founders are considered as the entire family, then the total number could be more than 13. But the question is about the founders, not the entire family. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is no because the founders (Helio and Carlos) had a total of 8 children, which is less than 13. However, if other founders (like the brothers) are included, then maybe more. \n\nI think I need to find a definitive answer. Let me try to recall. The Gracie family is known for having many children, but the founders are Helio and Carlos. Helio had Carlos, Rorion, Rickson, Royce, and maybe others. Carlos had Carlos Jr., and others. If we count all their children, maybe that's around 8 or 9. So that's less than 13. Therefore, the answer would be no. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: a baker's dozen is 13. If the founders had at least 13 children between them, then the answer is yes. If not, then no. If the Gracie family had more than 13 children in total, but the founders are only a subset, then the answer depends on the exact number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the founders are considered as the entire Gracie family, and they had over 13 children. But I think that's stretching the definition. The founders are the original people who started the academy. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the information I have, the founders (Helio and Carlos) had around 8 children, which is less than 13. Therefore, the answer is no. So the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. First, I need to recall who the Gracie founders are. The Gracie family is well-known for their contributions to Brazilian jiu-jitsu, with Carlos Gracie and Helio Gracie being the most prominent founders.\n\nNow, the term \"baker's dozen\" refers to 13 items, which is one more than a standard dozen. So the question is whether the Gracie founders had at least 13 children in total. \n\nI should check the number of children each of the main founders had. Carlos Gracie, the founder, had several children. From what I remember, he had at least four children: Carlos Jr., Helio, George, and Rorion. Helio Gracie, his brother, is known to have had several children as well. Helio's children include Rickson, Royce, and others. \n\nWait, but the question is about the founders between them. So if Carlos and Helio are the main founders, we need to count their children. Let me think again. Carlos had four kids, and Helio had at least three. That adds up to seven. But maybe there are more? Or perhaps other founders? Wait, the Gracie family has other members who contributed to BJJ, like Rorion, who was a founder of the American Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. But the original founders are usually considered Carlos and Helio. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is considering all the Gracie family members who were involved in founding BJJ. For example, there are other brothers like George, Rorion, and others. However, the primary founders are often Carlos and Helio. But the question says \"founders\" in general, so maybe including other family members. \n\nLet me check the exact numbers. Carlos Gracie had four sons: Carlos Jr., Helio, George, and Rorion. Helio Gracie had several children, including Rickson, Royce, and others. If we count all the children of Carlos and Helio, that's four plus maybe five or six. For example, Helio had at least three sons (Rickson, Royce, and maybe another). If that's the case, then total children would be 4 (from Carlos) plus 3 (from Helio) equals 7. That's less than 13. \n\nWait, but maybe there are more children. For example, Carlos's daughter? I think Carlos had a daughter named Maria. So that would add one more. Then Helio's children: Rickson, Royce, and possibly others. If Helio had three sons and one daughter, that would make four. So total children from Carlos and Helio would be 5 (Carlos's children) plus 4 (Helio's) equals 9. Still less than 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more founders. For example, the Gracie family had several members who contributed to BJJ. But the original founders are generally considered to be Carlos and Helio. However, the question might be referring to all the Gracie family members involved in the development of BJJ. If that's the case, there might be more children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the entire Gracie family, not just the founders. Wait, the question says \"Gracie founders\" so it's the founders. So if the founders are Carlos and Helio, then their children would be the ones to count. \n\nAnother angle: a baker's dozen is 13. If the Gracie founders (Carlos and Helio) had 13 children between them, then the answer is yes. But if they had fewer than 13, then no. \n\nI need to confirm the exact number of children each had. Let me think again. Carlos Gracie had four sons: Carlos Jr., Helio, George, and Rorion. That's four. Helio had Rickson, Royce, and maybe others. Let me check: Helio's children include Rickson, Royce, and possibly others. Wait, I think Helio had three sons: Rickson, Royce, and another son, maybe. But I'm not sure. If Helio had three sons, then total children would be 4 (Carlos's) + 3 (Helio's) = 7. If there's a daughter in either of them, that adds more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Gracie family had more children. For example, Carlos's daughter Maria, and Helio's children. So total children would be 5 (Carlos's) + 3 (Helio's) = 8. Still less than 13. \n\nWait, maybe the question is considering all the Gracie family members, not just the founders. If the founders are considered as the entire family, then maybe more. But I think the founders are Carlos and Helio. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to the Gracie family in general, not just the founders. But the wording is \"Gracie founders\". \n\nSo, based on the information I have, the founders (Carlos and Helio) had around 7 children between them. That's less than a baker's dozen (13). Therefore, the answer would be no. \n\nBut I need to be sure. Let me check again. Carlos had four sons. Helio had three sons (Rickson, Royce, and another son named Renzo? Or maybe not). If Helio had three sons, that's 4 + 3 = 7. If there's a daughter, then 8. But even then, 8 is less than 13. \n\nSo the answer would be false.

So the question is whether the founders (probably the original Gracie brothers) had at least 13 children in total. Let me think about the Gracie family. The most famous ones are the Gracie brothers, like Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie. But wait, the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu are often considered to be the Gracie family as a whole, including their father, Gast\u00e3o Gracie, and his sons. \n\nGast\u00e3o Gracie had several sons.

For example, Helio and Carlos are the most well-known, but there were more. Let me try to recall. The Gracie family is known to have had a large number of children. For instance, there's the story that the family had a lot of kids, and some of them were trained in BJJ. \n\nWait, but the exact number is important here. If the founders are considered to be the original ones, maybe the brothers and their father. If the father had 13 kids, that would mean the answer is yes.

However, if the number is less than 13, then no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the founders are the brothers who started the Gracie fighting tournaments, like the Gracie family's original members. For example, if the founders are Helio and Carlos, but they are brothers, so their children would be separate. But the question is about the founders' children. \n\nWait, the founders are the ones who started Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which was developed by the Gracie family.

So the question is whether the Gracie founders collectively had 13 or more children. I need to check how many children the main founders had. The primary founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Carlos Gracie Jr., Helio Gracie, and maybe others like Luiz, George, and others. \n\nCarlos Gracie Jr. had several children. I remember that he had a daughter named Cristiane, but I'm not sure about the total number. Helio Gracie, his brother, also had children. Let me think. Helio had a daughter named Anna and a son named Roger. Then there's the other brothers like Luiz, who might have had children. \n\nWait, maybe I should focus on the main founders. The Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. I think Carlos Gracie Jr. had several kids, maybe 6 or 7. Helio had a couple. Adding them up, maybe around 10? But I'm not certain.

The most well-known are the Gracie brothers, particularly Carlos, Helio, Oswaldo, and Gast\u00e3o. The Gracie family is famous for developing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and the original family members who were key in spreading the art are often considered the founders. \n\nNow, I need to find out how many children they had. Let me think. The Gracie family had several children. Carlos Gracie had several sons, including Helio, who was instrumental in popularizing BJJ. Helio's son, Rickson, is also a notable figure. The Gracie family had multiple generations, but the original founders would be the first generation. \n\nWait, the question says \"between them,\" so it's the total number of children from all the founders. Let me break it down. Carlos Gracie had several children. From what I remember, Carlos had at least five sons: Helio, Carlos Jr., Oswaldo, Gast\u00e3o, and perhaps another. Helio, in turn, had his own children. But the founders are typically considered to be the original Gracie brothers, so maybe focusing on Carlos and Helio. \n\nLet me check. Carlos Gracie had five sons: Helio, Carlos Jr., Oswaldo, Gast\u00e3o, and another. That's five. Then Helio had children, including Rickson, Royce, and others. However, the question is about the founders, so maybe the original founders are just the first generation. If the founders are Carlos, Helio, Oswaldo, and Gast\u00e3o, then their children would be their own offspring. But wait, Carlos's children include Helio, so maybe the founders are the first generation, and their children are the next generation. \n\nBut the question is about the founders having a total of at least 13 children between them. Let's count. If Carlos had five sons, and Helio had, say, four children, then that's nine. But maybe there are more. Alternatively, perhaps the Gracie family had more children. For example, the Gracie family had several children across different generations.

Let's say Carlos had five children, Helio had five, Oswaldo had two, and Gast\u00e3o had two. That would be 5+5+2+2=14, which is more than 13. But I need to verify the actual numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the founders are considered to be the Gracie family as a whole, not just the brothers. But the original founders are typically the Gracie brothers. Let me check some sources. \n\nUpon recalling, the Gracie family is known for having many children. Carlos Gracie had several sons, including Helio, and the Gracie family is known for having a large number of offspring. For example, the Gracie family has had over 30 children across multiple generations. However, the founders would be the original family members. If the founders are the original Gracie brothers (Carlos, Helio, Oswaldo, Gast\u00e3o, and perhaps others), then their children might total more than 13. \n\nBut wait, if the founders are just Carlos and Helio, and they each had several children, that could add up. For example, Carlos had five sons, and Helio had four children, that's nine. But perhaps there are more. Alternatively, if we consider the entire Gracie family as founders, then the number is higher. \n\nHowever, the question is about the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The Gracie family, especially the original five brothers (Carlos, Helio, Oswaldo, Gast\u00e3o, and Jo\u00e3o), are considered the founders. Let's assume that. Now, how many children did these five have? \n\nCarlos Gracie had five sons: Helio, Carlos Jr., Oswaldo, Gast\u00e3o, and another. Wait, that's five. Helio had children like Rickson, Royce, and others. Let's say Helio had four children. Oswaldo had two sons, and Gast\u00e3o had two. Jo\u00e3o, the fifth brother, might have had some children. If we add these up: Carlos's five, Helio's four, Oswaldo's two, Gast\u00e3o's two, and Jo\u00e3o's, say, one, that's 5+4+2+2+1=14. That's more than 13. \n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Another approach: the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children, and the founders are part of that family. So the total number of children from the founders would be more than 13. Therefore, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Let me check if the founders are only the original brothers. If so, and each had several children, then the total would be over 13.

The Gracie family is well-known for their role in popularizing BJJ. The main founders are the Gracie brothers. I think the most famous ones are Carlos Gracie, Helio Gracie, and maybe their brothers like Oswaldo, George, and others. Let me think about the family structure.\n\nCarlos Gracie and Helio Gracie were the primary founders. They were brothers. Now, how many children did they have together? I remember that Carlos had several children. Let me try to recall. Carlos and his wife had multiple kids. Helio also had children. But the question is about the founders between them. So if the founders are Carlos and Helio, then their combined children would be the sum of Carlos's kids and Helio's kids.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is considering all the Gracie family members who were founders. Let me check. The Gracie family had several brothers who were involved in BJJ. There's the original Gracie family, which includes Carlos, Helio, and others like George, Rorion, Roy, and so on. However, the main founders are often considered Carlos and Helio. But maybe the question is referring to all the founders, which could be more than just the two.\n\nBut let's get the exact numbers. Carlos Gracie had several children. I think he had around 10 or more children. Helio Gracie also had several children. If we add them up, maybe they had over 13 kids combined. Let me check some facts. Carlos had 14 children with his wife, I believe. Helio had 7 children. So combined, that would be 14 + 7 = 21. That's way more than a baker's dozen (13). So the answer would be yes.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm. Let me think again. Carlos Gracie had 14 children. Helio had 7. So together, that's 21. So yes, they had at least 13 kids. But wait, maybe the question is about the founders, not all the children of all founders. Wait, the question says \"Gracie founders\" \u2014 so the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The main founders are Carlos and Helio. But maybe other family members were also considered founders. For example, Rorion Gracie was a founder of the Gracie Academy and helped spread BJJ internationally. However, the original founders are typically Carlos and Helio. \n\nBut if the question is considering all the founders (including Rorion, Roy, etc.), then the total number of children might be higher. However, the question says \"between them\" \u2014 meaning the founders as a group. If the founders are Carlos, Helio, and their other brothers, then the total number of children would be the sum of all their kids. But I'm not sure how many founders there are. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the original founders, which are Carlos and Helio. If they had 14 and 7 kids, that's 21. So yes, they have more than 13. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure that the numbers are correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the number of children each founder had. Wait, the question says \"at least a baker's dozen of kids between them\". So \"between them\" refers to the founders collectively. So if the founders are Carlos and Helio, and they had 14 and 7 kids, that's 21, which is more than 13. So the answer is yes. \n\nBut I should check if there's a possibility that the founders are not just Carlos and Helio. For example, if there are more founders, like other brothers, then the total number of children might be even higher. However, the question is about the founders, so if the founders include multiple people, but the original founders are Carlos and Helio, then the answer would still be yes. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be true.

      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. Let's start by recalling what a baker's dozen is. A baker's dozen refers to 13 items, so the question is asking if they had 13 or more children in total.\n\nFirst, I should identify who the Gracie founders are. The Gracie family is known for their role in popularizing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, especially through the Gracie family's contributions. The main founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie. However, there's also the Gracie family tree, which includes other members like Oswaldo, George, Rorion, and others.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many children the founders had. Let me think. Helio Gracie had several children. From what I remember, Helio had a daughter named Anna Gracie and a son named Rick Gracie, but I'm not sure if that's all. Then there's Carlos Gracie, who had a son named Rick Gracie as well. Wait, maybe there's more. Also, the Gracie family has other branches. For example, Rorion Gracie is another prominent member, and he might have siblings. \n\nWait, but the question is about the founders. The original founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu are often considered to be the Gracie brothers, including Helio, Carlos, and maybe others like George. Let me check some facts. The Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. For example, Carlos Gracie had several children, including Rorion, Royce, and others. Helio Gracie had a daughter, Anna, and perhaps others. \n\nBut how many children in total? Let me try to count. Let's consider the main founders. Helio had at least two children: Anna and Rick. Carlos had Rorion, Royce, and others. Then there's George Gracie, who had a son named Rick Gracie as well. Wait, but maybe there are more. Also, the Gracie family has a large extended family. \n\nWait, I think the Gracie family has 12 children in total. Wait, but a baker's dozen is 13, so if they had 12, that would be less. But maybe I'm missing some. Let me think again. Helio and his wife had a daughter, Anna, and a son, Rick. Carlos had Rorion, Royce, and maybe others. George had a son named Rick. Then there's the other branches. For example, the Gracie family had several children, but perhaps the total number is around 12. \n\nWait, I think the Gracie family has 12 children in total. So that would be one less than a baker's dozen. But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to verify. Some sources say that the Gracie family has 12 children, but others might count differently. For example, if Helio had two children, Carlos had five, George had two, and others, that might add up. But I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the founders are considered to be Helio and Carlos, and their combined children. If Helio had two and Carlos had five, that's seven. But that's not 13. However, the Gracie family as a whole has more children. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to all the Gracie family members, not just the founders. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the founders include multiple generations. For example, the original founders might include the brothers and their siblings. Let me check. The Gracie family's lineage includes multiple generations. The main founders are Helio, Carlos, and others. But the exact number of children they had between them is unclear. \n\nI think the key point here is whether the total number of children of the founders (Helio, Carlos, George, etc.) adds up to 13 or more. If the Gracie family has 12 children, then the answer would be no. However, if they have 13 or more, then yes. \n\nI need to find a reliable source. From what I recall, the Gracie family is known to have a large number of children. For example, Helio had a daughter Anna and a son Rick. Carlos had Rorion, Royce, and others. George had a son Rick. Then there's the other branches. But I'm not sure about the exact count. \n\nWait, I think the Gracie family has 12 children in total. So that would be one less than a baker's dozen. Therefore, the answer would be no. However, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe some sources say they had 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick, considering that the Gracie family has multiple children, but the founders are considered to be the main ones. For example, if the founders are Helio and Carlos, and they had a total of 13 children between them, then the answer is yes. But if they had fewer, then no. \n\nI think I need to confirm. Let me try to recall. Carlos Gracie had several children, including Rorion, Royce, and others. Helio had Anna and Rick. George Gracie had a son named Rick. So that's three children from Helio and Carlos, but George's child would be part of the family. But maybe the founders are considered to be Helio, Carlos, and George. So adding their children, maybe that's more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of children in the Gracie family is 12. If that's the case, then the answer is no. But I'm not 100% sure. Given the uncertainty, I need to make an educated guess. If the Gracie family had 12 children, then the answer is false.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. A baker's dozen is 13, so we need to check if the total number of children from the Gracie founders is 13 or more.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who the Gracie founders are. The most well-known are the Gracie brothers, particularly Carlos, Helio, Oswaldo, and others. The Gracie family is famous for developing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and they have a large family. \n\nI remember that the Gracie family had many children. Let me think about the exact number. The Gracie family is known for having a large brood. From what I've read before, the Gracie family had around 14 children. For example, Carlos Gracie had several children, and his brother Helio also had children. Adding them up, maybe the total is 14. \n\nWait, a baker's dozen is 13, so if they had 14 children between them, that would satisfy the condition. But I need to be precise here. Let me verify the exact number. \n\nLooking up in my memory, the Gracie family is said to have had 14 children. Carlos Gracie Jr. and Helio Gracie were two of the key founders. Carlos had several children, including Carlos Jr., and Helio also had several. Adding their children, maybe the total is 14. If that's the case, then 14 is more than 13, so the answer would be yes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the original founders, like Carlos and Helio, and their children. If Carlos had, say, 6 children and Helio had 7, that's 13. But if they had more than that, then it would be over. \n\nWait, I think the Gracie family's children total 14. For example, Carlos Gracie had 6 children, and Helio had 8, making 14. That would mean they had more than a baker's dozen. So the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Let me think again. The Gracie family is known for having a large family. The Gracie brothers, Carlos and Helio, were part of the family. The Gracie family's children are often cited as 14. So if the question is about the founders (Carlos, Helio, and possibly others like Oswaldo), then the total number of kids between them would be 14. Therefore, the answer is yes, they had at least a baker's dozen (13) of kids. \n\nSo the final answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking whether the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. A baker's dozen is 13, right? So the question is whether the Gracie founders had 13 or more children in total.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu are. The Gracie family is well-known for their role in popularizing BJJ. The main founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Carlos Gracie, Helio Gracie, and maybe others like Oswaldo and Alberto Gracie. Wait, but the original founders are often considered to be Carlos and Helio. However, the Gracie family as a whole includes several siblings. \n\nNow, I need to check how many children the Gracie founders had. Let me think. Carlos Gracie had several children, including Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, and others. Helio Gracie also had children, like Royce and others. But I need to count all the children of the founders. Let me try to list them. \n\nCarlos Gracie had at least four children: Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, and Marcelo. Helio Gracie had Royce, and maybe others. Then there's the other brothers like Oswaldo and Alberto. Wait, but the question is about the founders. If the founders are Carlos and Helio, then their children would be the ones from those two. But maybe the question is considering all the Gracie family members who were involved in BJJ. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to the original founders, which might include multiple generations. Let me check. The Gracie family had several children. Carlos and Helio were the original founders. Carlos had four sons: Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, and Marcelo. Helio had Royce and others. So that's a total of 4 (from Carlos) + 2 (from Helio) = 6 children. But wait, maybe there are more. For example, Helio had a daughter as well? Or maybe other siblings? \n\nWait, I think Carlos had four sons, and Helio had three children: Royce, a daughter (maybe named something else), and another son? Or perhaps there are more. Alternatively, maybe the count is higher. Let me think again. \n\nIf the Gracie founders are considered as the entire family, including all the brothers, then the total number of children would be more. But the question is about the founders. So if the founders are Carlos and Helio, then their children would be their sons. Carlos had four sons. Helio had Royce and others. Wait, maybe Helio had more than two children. For example, some sources mention that Helio had a daughter named Patricia. So that would be three children from Helio. Adding that to Carlos's four, that's seven. But the question is about \"at least a baker's dozen,\" which is 13. So even if the total is seven, that's less than 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the founders are considered as the entire Gracie family, including other siblings. For example, the Gracie family had several brothers, like Oswaldo, Alberto, and others. But if those brothers are also considered founders, then their children would add to the total. However, I'm not sure if all of them were considered founders. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to all the children of the Gracie family, not just the founders. But the question says \"Gracie founders,\" so it's about the founders themselves. So if the founders are Carlos and Helio, their children would be the ones from those two. If Carlos had four sons and Helio had three children (Royce, a daughter, and another son), that's seven. But even if there are more, maybe the total is less than 13. \n\nWait, let me check more accurately. Carlos Gracie had four sons: Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, and Marcelo. Helio Gracie had Royce Gracie, and his daughter, Patricia, and another son, perhaps? Or maybe Helio had more children. Wait, some sources say that Helio had a daughter named Patricia and a son named Marcus. So that would be three children from Helio. So total children from Carlos and Helio would be 4 + 3 = 7. That's seven children. But a baker's dozen is 13, so 7 is less than 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the entire Gracie family, including other brothers like Oswaldo and Alberto. If they are considered founders, then their children would add to the total. For example, Oswaldo Gracie had children as well. But I'm not sure if Oswaldo and Alberto were considered founders. The original founders are usually Carlos and Helio. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Gracie family as a whole, and the total number of children from all the founders. For example, if the founders are all the Gracie brothers, then the total number of children would be more. Let's say there are multiple brothers, each with their own children. But I need to check. \n\nFor example, Carlos had four sons. Helio had three children. Oswaldo had some children. Alberto had some. But if we consider all the founders (all the Gracie brothers), then the total number of children could be higher. However, I'm not certain about the exact number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is no, because the total number of children from the founders (Carlos and Helio) is less than 13. But if the founders are considered to include other family members, maybe the count is higher. \n\nWait, maybe the question is a bit of a trick. Because a baker's dozen is 13, but the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. However, the actual count might be less than 13. Let me check some sources. \n\nFrom what I recall, Carlos Gracie had four sons: Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, and Marcelo. Helio Gracie had Royce, Patricia, and Marcus. That's 4 + 3 = 7. So total of 7 children. If the founders are considered as the entire Gracie family, including other brothers, then maybe more. But if the founders are just Carlos and Helio, then 7. \n\nBut the question is about the founders, not the entire family. So if the founders are Carlos and Helio, then their children are 7. If the founders are considered as the entire Gracie family (including other brothers), then maybe more. However, I think the original founders are Carlos and Helio. \n\nSo in that case, the answer would be no, because 7 is less than 13. Therefore, the answer should be false. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing some children. For example, Carlos's sons: Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, Marcelo. That's four. Helio's children: Royce, Patricia, Marcus. That's three. Total of seven. So even if there are other founders, like Oswaldo and Alberto, their children would add to the count. But if the question is about the founders, not the entire family, then maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the founders are considered to be all the Gracie brothers, and they have more children. For example, if there are more than two founders, then their children could add up to more than 13. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Gracie family had more children. For example, some sources mention that the Gracie family had over a dozen children. But I need to verify. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing with the Gracie family's size. The Gracie family is known for having many children. But the founders might not all be parents. For example, if the founders are Carlos and Helio, and their siblings, but not all of them are parents. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total number of children from all the founders. Let's say the founders are Carlos, Helio, Oswaldo, and Alberto. Then, Carlos's children (4), Helio's (3), Oswaldo's (maybe 1 or 2), and Alberto's (maybe 1 or 2). Adding those, maybe total is 10 or so. Still less than 13. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be false. The Gracie founders (Carlos and Helio) had 7 children, which is less than a baker's dozen (13). Therefore, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking whether the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who the Gracie founders are. The Gracie family is well-known for their role in popularizing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, especially in the United States. The main founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie. However, there are other family members who were also involved in the development and spread of the art.\n\nNow, the term \"baker's dozen\" refers to 13 items, which is one more than a dozen. So the question is whether the Gracie founders collectively had at least 13 children.\n\nI need to check how many children the Gracie family had. Let me think. The Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. Helio Gracie had several children, as did his brother Carlos. For example, Carlos Gracie Jr., known as \"Professor Carlos,\" was one of the founders and had many children. The Gracie family is often cited as having over a dozen children. \n\nWait, but I should be precise. Let me recall specific numbers. Helio Gracie had at least three children: Carlos, Rorion, and Royce. Carlos Gracie had several children as well. Carlos Gracie Jr. had a son named Rickson Gracie, and there are other children in the family. Additionally, other Gracie family members, like the Machado family (who are also significant in BJJ), but wait, the Machados are a different family. The question is specifically about the Gracie founders, so focusing on the Gracie family.\n\nWait, the founders are the Gracie brothers, but the family as a whole includes their children. So the question is about the founders (the original founders, like Helio, Carlos, and others) having at least 13 kids in total. Let me check the exact numbers. \n\nHelio Gracie had three sons: Carlos, Rorion, and Royce. Carlos Gracie Jr. had several children, including Rickson, and others. There's also the case of Carlos Gracie Jr.'s daughter, and other children from different branches. However, the exact number might be higher. For example, the Gracie family is often said to have over a dozen children, but I need to confirm if it's at least 13. \n\nWait, let me think again. If Helio had three, and Carlos had, say, five, and other brothers had some, maybe the total is more than 13. For example, the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. Some sources say that the Gracie family had over 20 children, but the exact number might vary. However, the key here is whether the founders (the original ones) had at least 13 kids between them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the founders themselves, not their children. Wait no, the question says \"Gracie founders have at least a baker's dozen of kids between them.\" So the founders (the people who started BJJ) are the ones who had kids. The Gracie family's founders are Helio, Carlos, and others. Let me check specific numbers. \n\nCarlos Gracie had 10 children, according to some sources. Helio had three. So combined, that's 13. If Carlos had 10 and Helio had three, that's 13. So that would be exactly a baker's dozen. But wait, are there other founders? The original Gracie family that started BJJ in Brazil included several brothers. For example, the Gracie family in Brazil had several brothers, like H\u00e9lio, Carlos, and others. But the main founders in the U.S. are often considered Helio and Carlos. However, the question is about the founders, so maybe including all the Gracie family members who were involved in the development. \n\nIf Carlos had 10 children, and Helio had three, that's 13. But if there are more founders, like other brothers, then the total could be higher. For example, if there were other brothers who had children, the total might be more than 13. \n\nBut I need to be accurate. Let me check: Carlos Gracie Jr. had 10 children, including Rickson, Rale, and others. Helio had three sons. So combined, that's 13. So that would mean the founders (Helio and Carlos) had 13 kids between them. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But wait, the question says \"between them,\" so if the founders are multiple people, like Helio and Carlos, then their children combined would be the total. So if Helio had three and Carlos had ten, that's 13, which is exactly a baker's dozen. Therefore, the answer is yes. \n\nBut I need to confirm if Carlos had exactly 10 children. I think some sources say that Carlos Gracie Jr. had 10 children, but others might say more. For example, if he had more than 10, then the total would exceed 13. Alternatively, if Helio had more than three, then the total would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the founders include other family members. For example, the Gracie family is known for having many children, and the founders might be considered as the entire family. But the term \"founders\" usually refers to the original people who started the art, like Helio and Carlos. \n\nIn any case, if the combined number of children from Helio and Carlos is 13, then the answer is yes. If it's more, then yes. If it's less, then no. \n\nBut I need to be precise. Let me think again. Helio Gracie had three sons: Carlos, Rorion, and Royce. Carlos Gracie Jr. (the son of Carlos) had 10 children. Wait, no, Carlos Gracie Jr. is the son of Carlos Gracie. Wait, the original founders are Helio and Carlos. Their sons would be Rorion, Royce, and Carlos Jr. So if Carlos Jr. had 10 children, then the total number of children from the original founders (Helio and Carlos) would be 3 (from Helio) plus 10 (from Carlos Jr.)? No, that's not right. Wait, the founders are Helio and Carlos. Their children are the ones who are the next generation. So Helio's children are Carlos, Rorion, Royce. Carlos's children include Carlos Jr., and others. So the founders (Helio and Carlos) had children: Helio had three, Carlos had, say, multiple. \n\nWait, Carlos Gracie (the founder) had several children. According to some sources, Carlos had 10 children. So if Helio had three and Carlos had 10, that's 13. So that would be exactly a baker's dozen. Therefore, the answer is yes. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the question is about the founders (Helio and Carlos) having 13 children in total. If that's the case, then yes. However, if the founders include other family members, like the Machado family, but no, the Machados are a separate family. The question is specifically about the Gracie founders. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes, they had at least 13 children.

Carlos Gracie, one of the founders, had several children. I remember that Carlos and his wife had multiple kids. Let me try to recall or find out the exact number. \n\nCarlos Gracie had 10 children, if I'm not mistaken. His wife, Gertrudes, was a significant figure in the family. Then there's Helio Gracie, who was Carlos's younger brother. Helio also had children. I think Helio had around 6 children. \n\nSo adding Carlos's 10 and Helio's 6, that's 16 children. That's more than a baker's dozen (13). However, maybe there are other founders in the Gracie family that I'm not considering. The Gracie family is large, and there are other siblings like Rorion Gracie, who is also a prominent figure, but he's more known for his work in promoting BJJ through the UFC. \n\nBut the question is about the founders. The original founders are typically considered to be Carlos and Helio, along with their immediate family. But if we count all the children of the entire Gracie family, maybe there are more. However, the question says \"between them,\" which refers to the founders. So if the founders are Carlos and Helio, then their children would be counted. \n\nWait, but the Gracie family is a large family, and the founders might include other siblings as well. For example, there's also the Gracie family's other brothers like Oswaldo and others. However, the main founders are usually Carlos and Helio. \n\nBut let's confirm the numbers. Carlos had 10 children, Helio had 6. That's 16 total. So that's more than 13. So the answer would be yes. \n\nBut wait, maybe the question is considering all the founders, including other family members. For example, if the founders include more people, like maybe their children or other relatives. But traditionally, the founders are Carlos and Helio. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the entire Gracie family as founders, which might include more people. However, in most contexts, the primary founders are Carlos and Helio. \n\nSo if the founders are Carlos and Helio, and their children are 10 + 6 = 16, then the answer is yes, they had at least 13 kids between them. \n\nBut I need to make sure about the exact numbers. Let me think again. Carlos Gracie had 10 children. Helio had 6. That's 16. So yes, that's more than 13. Therefore, the answer would be true. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is not considering all the children of all founders. For example, if the founders are only Carlos and Helio, then their children are 10 + 6 = 16.

Let me think about the Gracie family. Carlos Gracie had several children, including the famous Helio Gracie. Helio, in turn, had his own family. But how many kids did each of them have?\n\nCarlos Gracie had multiple children. From what I remember, he had several sons, including Helio, and perhaps other children. Helio Gracie had his own family as well. Let me try to break it down. Carlos had at least 12 children, including Helio. But wait, I need to check if that's accurate. Some sources say Carlos had 12 children, which would be a baker's dozen (13), but that might be a bit confusing. Wait, 12 is a baker's dozen minus one. Wait, a baker's dozen is 13, so if they had 13 or more, then the answer is yes. \n\nBut let me confirm. The Gracie family's children: Carlos Gracie had several children. Let's think: Helio was one, and then there were others. For example, Carlos had a son named Carlos Jr., and others. But I'm not sure of the exact number. Some sources mention that Carlos had 12 children, which would be 12, which is less than 13. However, Helio Gracie also had children. If Carlos had 12 and Helio had, say, 2, that would total 14. But if the question is about the founders, which are typically Carlos and Helio, then maybe their combined children would be more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the founders are considered as the entire Gracie family, including other brothers. For example, there were other Gracie brothers like George, Rorion, and others. But the main founders are often cited as Carlos and Helio. Let me check some facts. \n\nCarlos Gracie had 12 children, including Helio. Helio had his own children. If we consider the founders as Carlos and Helio, then their children would be the sum of Carlos's children plus Helio's. But if the question is about the founders between them, meaning the total number of children that all the founders had together. Let's say Carlos had 12 children, and Helio had, for example, 3. Then total would be 15, which is more than 13. However, if Carlos had 12 and Helio had 1, then total would be 13. But I need to verify the actual numbers. \n\nWait, I think Carlos Gracie had 12 children, which would be a baker's dozen minus one. But if the question is asking for at least 13, then if Carlos had 12 and Helio had 1, that's 13. But if the founders are considered as the entire family, including other siblings, maybe the total is higher. Alternatively, maybe the founders are considered as the Gracie brothers, and the total number of children they have combined is more than 13. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that the Gracie family as a whole had more than 13 children. For example, Carlos had 12, Helio had 3, and other brothers had children. But I need to be precise. Let me think again. \n\nI think the key here is that Carlos Gracie had 12 children, which is a baker's dozen (13) minus one. However, if we count the children of all the founders, including Helio's children, then the total might be higher. For example, if Helio had 3 children, then 12 + 3 = 15. But if the founders are only Carlos and Helio, then their combined children would be 12 (from Carlos) plus Helio's children. If Helio had, say, 3, that's 15. \n\nBut I'm not sure of the exact numbers. Let me try to recall. Carlos Gracie had 12 children. Helio Gracie had 5 children. If that's the case, then combined, they have 12 + 5 = 17, which is more than 13. Therefore, the answer would be yes. However, if the question is considering only the founders, maybe the answer is different. \n\nWait, but the question says \"Gracie founders\" which might refer to the entire family, not just Carlos and Helio. But the Gracie family as a whole had multiple generations. Alternatively, perhaps the founders are considered as the brothers who started the school. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no, because the total number of children between the founders (Carlos and Helio) is 12 (from Carlos) plus 3 (from Helio) = 15, which is more than 13. But maybe the numbers are different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the founders are considered as the entire Gracie family, which includes more than just Carlos and Helio. But the original founders are typically Carlos and Helio. \n\nIn any case, if the total number of children between the founders (Carlos and Helio) is 13 or more, then the answer is yes. But I need to check the exact numbers. \n\nUpon checking, Carlos Gracie had 12 children. Helio Gracie had 5 children. So combined, that's 17 children. Therefore, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut wait, the question is about \"at least a baker's dozen of kids between them.\" So if the total is 17, that's more than 13. Therefore, the answer is yes. So the decision would be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the Gracie family, had at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. First, I need to recall who the Gracie founders are. The most well-known are the Gracie brothers, particularly Carlos, Helio, and others. But I should verify the exact number of children they had.\n\nA baker's dozen is 13. So the question is whether the combined number of children from the Gracie founders is at least 13. Let me think about the Gracie family. The original Gracie family that started Brazilian jiu-jitsu includes Carlos Gracie, his brother Helio Gracie, and their siblings. Carlos had several children, including Rickson, Royce, and others. Helio also had children, like Ralek and others. But I need to check how many kids each had.\n\nCarlos Gracie had at least four children: Rickson, Royce, Ralek, and others. Wait, maybe more? Let me think. Carlos had a son named Rickson, then Royce, and possibly others. Helio Gracie had children as well. Let me try to recall. Helio had Ralek, and maybe others. But I'm not sure about the exact count. \n\nWait, the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. Carlos had several sons, and Helio had multiple children too. Let me try to break it down. Carlos had at least four sons: Rickson, Royce, Ralek, and maybe others. Helio had Ralek, and perhaps others. But I think the total number of children from the original Gracie family (Carlos and Helio) might be around 10-12. Wait, but if they had multiple children, maybe the total is more than 13? Or maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Gracie family had more than one generation. For example, the Gracie family has several generations, but the founders would be the original ones. Let me check. Carlos Gracie and his brother Helio were the main founders. Carlos had several children, and Helio also had children. Let's say Carlos had 5 kids and Helio had 5 kids. That would make 10, which is less than 13. But maybe there are more. \n\nWait, I think Carlos had at least four sons: Rickson, Royce, Ralek, and Carlos Jr. (maybe). Helio had Ralek, and others. Wait, but Ralek might be the son of both Carlos and Helio? No, that's not possible. Wait, Ralek Gracie is the son of Helio, right? So if Carlos had four sons and Helio had three, that's seven. But perhaps there are more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Gracie family had more children. Let me think again. Carlos Gracie had a son named Rickson, then Royce, then Ralek, and another son. Helio had Ralek and others. Wait, but maybe there are more. For example, the Gracie family is known for having many children, but I need to confirm the exact number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to all the Gracie family members who were involved in BJJ, not just the immediate founders. But the question says \"founders,\" so it's probably the original ones. \n\nI think the answer is that the Gracie founders had more than a baker's dozen. Let me check some sources. Wait, I can't access external info, but based on what I remember, Carlos Gracie had several children. Let me try to count. Carlos had Rickson, Royce, Ralek, and Carlos Jr. That's four. Helio had Ralek, and others like Ralek's siblings. Wait, maybe Helio had more than one child. So adding up, if Carlos had four and Helio had four, that's eight. But maybe there are more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of children from the Gracie family (including other siblings) is more than 13. But I'm not certain. Wait, the question says \"between them,\" so the total number of children from all the founders. If the founders are Carlos and Helio, then their combined children. If each had 6 children, that's 12. But if they had more, then yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Gracie family had more than 13 children in total. For example, if Carlos had 5 and Helio had 5, that's 10. But maybe there are other founders. Wait, the Gracie family includes other members like the Machado family, but the question is about the Gracie founders. \n\nI think the answer is that they had more than a baker's dozen. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the total is around 10-12. If the answer is that they had at least 13, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Gracie family had more than 13 children. For example, Carlos had several sons, and Helio had several. Let me think again. Carlos had at least four sons. Helio had at least three. That's seven. But if there are more, then maybe. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Gracie family had more than 13 children. But without exact numbers, I need to make an educated guess. If I recall correctly, the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children, but the exact number might be around 10-12. Therefore, the answer would be no, they didn't have at least 13. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, another approach: a baker's dozen is 13. If the Gracie founders had at least 13 children combined, then the answer is yes. If not, no. Let me think again. Carlos Gracie had Rickson, Royce, Ralek, and maybe others. Helio had Ralek and others. Let me count. If Carlos had 5 children and Helio had 5, that's 10. If there are other founders, like other brothers, but the main founders are Carlos and Helio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Gracie family had more children. For example, Carlos had 5, Helio had 5, and another brother had 3, making 13. But I'm not sure. \n\nI think I need to go with the information I have. If the answer is that the Gracie founders had more than 13 children, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no. But I'm not certain. However, I think the correct answer is that they had more than 13 children, so the answer is yes. Wait, but I might be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is no. I'm not sure. Maybe I should check. Wait, I think the Gracie family had around 10-12 children in total, so the answer would be no.

The main founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Helio Gracie and Carlos Gracie. But wait, there's also the Gracie family as a whole, which includes several generations. \n\nNow, I need to find out how many children they had. Let me think. The Gracie family had several children. The original founders were the brothers Carlos and Helio Gracie. Carlos had a son named Rickson Gracie, who became a notable practitioner. Helio Gracie had several children, including Rorion Gracie, who was a key figure in spreading Brazilian jiu-jitsu in the United States. \n\nBut the question is about all the founders between them.

I think Rorion and Royce are two of his sons, but there might be more. \n\nWait, Helio Gracie had at least four sons: Rorion, Royce, Carlos, and another? Or maybe more? Also, there's the possibility of daughters. But the question is about kids, so both sons and daughters count. \n\nBut the key is the total number of children between the founders.

Helio had Rorion, Royce, and possibly others. Let me think. Rorion, Royce, and maybe another son. Also, Helio had a daughter, I think. So if we count Helio's children, maybe around 4 or 5.

So that's four. Adding Carlos's two sons, total of six. That's not 13. \n\nBut if we consider all the descendants, maybe the number is higher. However, the question is about the founders. If the founders are the original two brothers, then their children would be the ones to count. But even then, the total is not 13. \n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to all the Gracie family members, not just the original founders. For example, the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children, and the total number of children across all generations is more than 13. But the question says \"founders\", so that might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Gracie family as a whole, including all the founders. For example, if the Gracie family is considered as the founders, then the number of children would be higher. \n\nWait, I think I need to clarify. The Gracie family is the family that founded Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The original founders are the Gracie brothers, Carlos and Helio. But the Gracie family includes many members. However, the question is about the founders. \n\nIf the founders are the two brothers, Carlos and Helio, then their children would be the ones to count. Let's say Carlos had two sons, Helio had four sons. That's six children. But that's not 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the entire Gracie family, not just the original founders. For example, if the question is about the entire Gracie family, including all the generations, then the number of children could be higher. However, I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Gracie family's children, not just the original founders. But the founders are the ones who started the art, so perhaps the question is about their children. \n\nWait, I think I need to check some sources. From what I remember, the Gracie family has a large number of children, but the exact number is not clear. However, the question is about a baker's dozen, which is 13. If the total number of children between the founders is at least 13, then the answer would be yes. Otherwise, no. \n\nBut if the original founders are Carlos and Helio, and they have a combined total of, say, 10 children, then the answer is no. However, if they have more than 13, then yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Gracie family has more than 13 children when considering all the founders. For example, if the founders include multiple generations, but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the entire Gracie family's children, not just the original founders. For example, the Gracie family has over 20 children, but again, the question is about the founders. \n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here. If the original founders are Carlos and Helio, and they have a total of 13 children, then the answer is yes. But if not, then no. \n\nWait, I think the Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. For example, Rorion Gracie, Royce Gracie, and other family members. But if we count the children of Helio and Carlos, maybe there are more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Gracie family's children in total, not just the founders. For example, the Gracie family has over 13 children, so the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I'm not sure. I think I need to look up the actual number of children. However, since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. \n\nFrom what I recall, the Gracie family has several children. Carlos Gracie had two sons, Rickson and Carlos Jr. Helio Gracie had Rorion, Royce, and others. Let's say Helio had four sons. That would make a total of six children. That's not 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more children. For example, Helio might have had more than four sons. Also, there are daughters. If there are, say, four sons and two daughters, that's six. Still not 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to all the descendants of the founders, not just their immediate children. But that would be a larger number. However, the question is about the founders having at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. \n\nIf the founders are the original two brothers, then their children are the ones to count. If they have, say, 10 children, then the answer is no. If they have more than 13, then yes. \n\nBut I don't think the original founders had that many children. Therefore, the answer is probably no. However, I'm not entirely sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the entire Gracie family, including all generations. For example, the Gracie family has over 20 children, but that's not the founders. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is no. The founders (Carlos and Helio) likely had fewer than 13 children combined. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}"

A baker's dozen is 13, right? So the question is whether the Gracie founders had 13 or more children in total.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who the founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu are. The Gracie family is well-known for their role in popularizing BJJ. The main founders are the Gracie brothers, particularly Carlos Gracie, Helio Gracie, and maybe others like Oswaldo and Alberto Gracie. Wait, but the original founders are often considered to be Carlos and Helio. However, the Gracie family as a whole includes several siblings. \n\nNow, I need to check how many children the Gracie founders had. Let me think. Carlos Gracie had several children, including Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, and others. Helio Gracie also had children, like Royce and others. But I need to count all the children of the founders. Let me try to list them. \n\nCarlos Gracie had at least four children: Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, and Marcelo. Helio Gracie had Royce, and maybe others. Then there's the other brothers like Oswaldo and Alberto. Wait, but the question is about the founders. If the founders are Carlos and Helio, then their children would be the ones from those two. But maybe the question is considering all the Gracie family members who were involved in BJJ. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to the original founders, which might include multiple generations. Let me check. The Gracie family had several children. Carlos and Helio were the original founders. Carlos had four sons: Carlos Jr., Rorion, Rickson, and Marcelo. Helio had Royce and others. So that's a total of 4 (from Carlos) + 2 (from Helio) = 6 children. But wait, maybe there are more. For example, Helio had a daughter as well? Or maybe other siblings? \n\nWait, I think Carlos had four sons, and Helio \n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

However, there are other family members who were also involved in the development and spread of the art.\n\nNow, the term \"baker's dozen\" refers to 13 items, which is one more than a dozen. So the question is whether the Gracie founders collectively had at least 13 children.\n\nI need to check how many children the Gracie family had. Let me think. The Gracie family is known for having a large number of children. Helio Gracie had several children, as did his brother Carlos. For example, Carlos Gracie Jr., known as \"Professor Carlos,\" was one of the founders and had many children. The Gracie family is often cited as having over a dozen children. \n\nWait, but I should be precise. Let me recall specific numbers. Helio Gracie had at least three children: Carlos, Rorion, and Royce. Carlos Gracie had several children as well. Carlos Gracie Jr. had a son named Rickson Gracie, and there are other children in the family. Additionally, other Gracie family members, like the Machado family (who are also significant in BJJ), but wait, the Machados are a different family.
