      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Hmm. First, I need to think about Disney princesses and their hair colors. The classic ones like Snow White, Elsa from Frozen, Rapunzel, etc. Snow White has blonde hair, Elsa has blue hair, Rapunzel has golden hair. But wait, there's also Merida from Brave, who has red hair. So Merida is a Disney princess with red hair. Now, does she appear on Broadway? There's a Broadway show called \"Beauty and the Beast,\" but Merida isn't in that. Wait, there's also \"Frozen\" on Broadway. The musical \"Frozen\" features Elsa and Anna, but Merida isn't part of that. However, there might be other productions. Let me think. Are there any Broadway shows that feature Merida? Maybe not. But the question is about any Disney princess on Broadway. So if Merida is in a Broadway show, then the answer would be yes. But if she isn't, then maybe not. Alternatively, maybe there's another Disney princess with red hair in a Broadway production. Wait, the original question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So maybe the answer depends on whether any such princess is portrayed with red hair. For example, if there's a show where a Disney princess is performed with red hair, regardless of which princess. But Merida is a Disney princess with red hair. If she's on Broadway, then yes. But if not, then maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there's another princess. Let me check. There's a Broadway show called \"Cinderella,\" but Cinderella's hair is usually golden. The \"Little Mermaid\" musical? The Little Mermaid has red hair. Wait, Ariel from The Little Mermaid has red hair. So if there's a Broadway production of \"The Little Mermaid,\" then Ariel would have red hair. But I'm not sure if that's the case. However, the question is whether a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. If there's a Broadway show featuring Ariel (from Little Mermaid) with red hair, then the answer is yes. Alternatively, maybe the answer is yes because Merida is a Disney princess with red hair, and if she's on Broadway, then it's true. But if she's not on Broadway, then maybe not. Wait, the question is phrased as \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" So it's not about whether a particular princess is on Broadway, but whether any Disney princess (on Broadway) has red hair. So if any Broadway show features a Disney princess with red hair, then the answer is yes. For example, if there's a show where Ariel is portrayed with red hair, then yes. But I need to confirm if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the answer is yes because Merida is a Disney princess with red hair, and if she's in a Broadway show, then the answer is yes. However, if there's no such show, then the answer would be no. But the user is asking for a yes/no answer. Since the question is general, perhaps the answer is yes because there exists at least one Disney princess (like Merida) who has red hair, and if she's on Broadway, then the answer is yes. However, I need to check if Merida is actually on Broadway. Wait, there's a Broadway production called \"Frozen\" which is based on the movie, but Merida isn't part of that. The Little Mermaid has Ariel with red hair. If there's a Broadway production of The Little Mermaid, then Ariel would have red hair. But I think that the Broadway version of The Little Mermaid is more of a stage adaptation, and I'm not sure if it's currently running. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that it's possible, so the answer is yes. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because the question is about a specific instance. Wait, the question is phrased as \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" So it's not about whether there exists such a princess, but whether any Disney princess currently on Broadway has red hair. Since I don't have current information on all Broadway productions, but based on known characters, Merida and Ariel have red hair. If they are on Broadway, then the answer is yes. However, if they are not, then no. But the question is general. Maybe the answer is yes, assuming that there is at least one such production. Alternatively, the answer might be no because, for example, the Broadway version of Frozen doesn't have red-haired princesses. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because the question is about a specific case, but I need to make a decision. Since Merida is a Disney princess with red hair, and if she is in a Broadway show, then yes. But without specific information, maybe the answer is no. Wait, perhaps the answer is no because the classic Disney princesses on Broadway (like in Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella) don't have red hair. But if there's a production that includes a red-haired princess, then yes. Since the question is general, and there exists at least one possible case (like Ariel in The Little Mermaid), the answer might be yes. However, without knowing if that's currently on Broadway, it's tricky. But since the question is asking whether it's true in general, maybe the answer is yes. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is no because there's no known Broadway production of a Disney princess with red hair. I'm a bit confused. Maybe the answer is false. Wait, the user is asking for a yes/no answer. Let me think again. The question is \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" If there's any instance where a Disney princess is on Broadway with red hair, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no. Since Merida is a Disney princess with red hair, and if she is on Broadway, then the answer is yes. But if not, then no. However, without knowing if she is on Broadway, perhaps the answer is no. But the question is not about whether Merida is on Broadway, but whether any Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. If there's a Broadway show that features a Disney princess with red hair, then yes. For example, if there's a show called \"Merida\" on Broadway, then yes. But I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest answer is no, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the answer is yes because there are Disney princesses with red hair, and if they are on Broadway, then the answer is yes. However, the question is not about whether they are on Broadway, but whether a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. So the answer depends on the existence of such a production. Since I don't have current information, maybe the answer is no. Alternatively, maybe the answer is yes because there is at least one possible case. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is no because the classic Disney princesses on Broadway (like in Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella) don't have red hair. But if there's a production that includes Merida or Ariel, then yes. However, without specific information, I might have to say no. Wait, but the question is not asking about a specific production, but whether there exists any such case. So if there is any case, then yes. Since Merida is a Disney princess with red hair, and if she is on Broadway, then the answer is yes. But if she isn't, then no. Since I don't know if she is on Broadway, maybe the answer is no. Alternatively, the answer could be yes because there is a possibility. But I think the correct answer is no because there's no known Broadway production of a Disney princess with red hair. Wait, but the question is about \"a Disney princess on Broadway,\" which could be any production. For example, if a theater company does a production of \"The Little Mermaid\" with Ariel having red hair, then the answer is yes. But if they don't, then no. Since the question is general, but without specific information, perhaps the answer is no. However, the user might be expecting a yes because there is a possibility. But I think the answer is no, because the question is about current Broadway shows, and I'm not aware of any. Alternatively, the answer is yes. I'm confused. Maybe the answer is no. Wait, the original question is in the present tense. So if there's a current Broadway show with a Disney princess with red hair, then yes. Otherwise, no. Since I don't have that information, but based on known productions, the answer is probably no. So I'll go with false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" I need to answer with a JSON object indicating true or false.\n\nFirst, I should clarify what exactly the question is asking. It's about Disney princesses who are on Broadway. So, I need to think about which Disney princesses have been featured in Broadway shows and their hair color.\n\nThe most well-known Disney princesses are characters like Elsa from Frozen, Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Belle from Beauty and the Beast, Rapunzel from Tangled, and Snow White. Now, considering Broadway productions, there's \"Frozen\" which is a Broadway musical, and \"Beauty and the Beast\" is also a Broadway show. \n\nElsa from Frozen has white hair, right? She's usually depicted with ice-themed hair, which is white or silver. Ariel from The Little Mermaid has red hair in the original movie, but I'm not sure if the Broadway version changes that. However, the Broadway version of \"The Little Mermaid\" might have different designs, but I think Ariel's hair is still red. Wait, but the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So if there's a Broadway show featuring a Disney princess, like \"Frozen\" or \"Beauty and the Beast,\" then the princess in that show would have the hair color as per the character's design.\n\nWait, the question is not about the original movie characters, but about the Broadway versions. So, for example, in the Broadway version of \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Belle is the princess. In the movie, Belle has brown hair, but in the Broadway show, does her hair color change? I think the Broadway production might have some differences, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the original Disney princesses in their respective Broadway adaptations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific character. For example, in the Broadway show \"Frozen,\" Elsa is a princess with white hair. So if the question is whether a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair, then the answer would depend on which princess. If the Broadway show features a princess with red hair, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"a Disney princess on Broadway,\" which is general. So is there any Disney princess on Broadway with red hair? Let's think. Ariel from The Little Mermaid has red hair. If there's a Broadway show that features Ariel, then the answer would be yes. However, \"The Little Mermaid\" is a Broadway musical, so Ariel is a character there. So in that case, the answer would be yes. But wait, the original question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So if the Broadway show includes a Disney princess with red hair, then the answer is yes. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user is thinking of a specific instance. For example, if the question is about a particular production or if there's a common misconception. Let me check some facts. The Broadway production of \"The Little Mermaid\" has Ariel with red hair, as per the original character. So if the question is asking whether there exists a Disney princess on Broadway with red hair, the answer would be yes. However, if the question is asking if all Disney princesses on Broadway have red hair, then the answer is no. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" which is a general yes/no question. So if there exists at least one Disney princess on Broadway with red hair, the answer is yes. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is referring to the original Disney princesses. For example, Snow White, Cinderella, etc. But those are not in Broadway shows. The Broadway shows that have Disney princesses are the ones based on the movies, like \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Frozen,\" \"The Little Mermaid,\" etc. \n\nSo, in the case of \"The Little Mermaid\" on Broadway, Ariel has red hair. Therefore, the answer would be yes. However, if the user is thinking of other princesses, like Elsa (white hair) or Belle (brown), then the answer would be no. But the question is general, so if there's at least one case where a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair, the answer is yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking about a specific princess. But the question is not specific. Therefore, the answer would be yes because Ariel from The Little Mermaid is a Disney princess on Broadway with red hair. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm if \"The Little Mermaid\" is indeed a Broadway show. Yes, it's a Broadway musical. So Ariel is a Disney princess in a Broadway show with red hair. Therefore, the answer is yes. \n\nBut maybe the user is confused because in some adaptations, the hair color might be different. However, the original character has red hair, and the Broadway version likely keeps that. So the answer should be yes. \n\nWait, but I should double-check. Let me think. The Little Mermaid's Broadway show, \"The Little Mermaid,\" features Ariel with red hair. Therefore, the answer is yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the princess in \"Cinderella\" on Broadway. But \"Cinderella\" is a Disney film, but the Broadway show might not be a direct adaptation. However, there's a \"Cinderella\" musical on Broadway, which is based on the Disney film. In that case, Cinderella's hair is typically brown. So that's not red. \n\nBut the key is that there exists at least one Disney princess on Broadway with red hair. Since Ariel from The Little Mermaid is such a case, the answer is yes. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Hmm. First, I need to think about which Disney princesses are on Broadway. The most famous one is probably \"Cinderella,\" but there's also \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Aladdin,\" and others. Wait, there's a musical called \"Cinderella\" that's on Broadway. Let me recall the characters.\n\nCinderella's stepmother and stepsisters have red hair, right? But the main character, Cinderella, is usually depicted with blonde hair. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, in some versions, Cinderella's hair is golden or brown. But the step-sisters are often shown with red hair. But the question is about the Disney princess herself. So if the Broadway show is based on Cinderella, then the main princess (Cinderella) might not have red hair. However, if there's another Disney princess in a Broadway show, like maybe \"Tangled\" or \"Frozen,\" but those are less likely. \n\nWait, there's a Broadway show called \"Beauty and the Beast\" which is based on the Disney movie. The princess in that is Belle. Belle is usually depicted with brown hair. So she doesn't have red hair. Then there's \"Aladdin,\" but the main character is Aladdin, not a princess. Wait, Jasmine is the princess. In the Broadway version, Jasmine's hair is usually dark brown or black. \n\nWait, maybe there's a different show. Let me think. There's also \"The Little Mermaid\" on Broadway, but the main character is Ariel, who has red hair. Wait, Ariel in the original Disney movie has red hair, right? So if there's a Broadway show based on \"The Little Mermaid,\" then the princess (Ariel) would have red hair. But is there a Broadway version of \"The Little Mermaid\"? I'm not sure. The original Broadway show was \"The Little Mermaid\" in 1983, but I think it was more of a revue. Then there was a revival in 2018. So if that's considered, then Ariel would have red hair. But the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. \n\nBut the original question is about any Disney princess on Broadway. So if there's a Broadway show that features a Disney princess with red hair, then the answer is yes. However, the main Disney princesses in Broadway shows are Cinderella, Belle, Jasmine, and Ariel. Let me check each:\n\n- Cinderella: Main character, usually has golden or brown hair. Step-sisters have red hair, but not the princess herself.\n- Belle: Brown hair.\n- Jasmine: Dark hair.\n- Ariel: Red hair (in the original movie and the Broadway show).\n\nSo if the Broadway show is \"The Little Mermaid,\" then Ariel (a Disney princess) has red hair. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But wait, the user might be referring to the more popular Broadway shows. However, the question is general. So if there exists at least one Disney princess on Broadway with red hair, the answer is yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the \"Cinderella\" musical where the step-sisters have red hair, but the princess (Cinderella) doesn't. So the answer depends on which princess is being referred to. \n\nBut the question is not specific. So if there's any Disney princess on Broadway with red hair, then the answer is yes. Since Ariel in \"The Little Mermaid\" has red hair, and that show is on Broadway, then the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I need to confirm if \"The Little Mermaid\" is considered a Broadway show. Yes, the original 1983 show was on Broadway, and the 2018 revival. So Ariel is a Disney princess in a Broadway show with red hair. Therefore, the answer is yes. \n\nWait, but the user might be thinking of the main princesses in the most popular shows. However, the question is general. So the answer would be yes. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. First, I need to figure out which Disney princesses are on Broadway. The most famous one is probably Elsa from Frozen, since there's a Broadway musical called \"Frozen.\" But wait, are there other Disney princesses in Broadway shows?\n\nI know that \"Cinderella\" has been on Broadway, but the original Disney version's princess is Cinderella, who is usually depicted with dark hair. Then there's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" which has Belle, who has dark hair. \"The Lion King\" is another Broadway show, but that's based on a Disney movie, and the main character is Simba, not a princess. \n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to a specific show. Let me think. The \"Frozen\" musical has Elsa, who is known for her ice powers and her hair is blue, not red. There's also the \"Aladdin\" musical, but Jasmine has dark hair. \n\nAre there any other Disney princesses in Broadway shows? Maybe \"Mulan\" or \"Pocahontas,\" but I don't recall any Broadway productions of those. Also, the original Disney princesses like Snow White, Aurora, or Ariel\u2014do they have Broadway adaptations? I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So, if there's a Broadway show that features a Disney princess, does that princess have red hair? Let me check. \n\nElsa from Frozen has blue hair, not red. Belle from Beauty and the Beast has brown hair. Jasmine from Aladdin has dark hair. The only Disney princess with red hair is maybe Pocahontas? Wait, no, Pocahontas has dark hair. Wait, maybe Tiana from The Princess and the Frog? She has dark hair too. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is no because none of the Disney princesses in Broadway shows have red hair. But wait, are there any other shows? For example, \"Cinderella\" has a character named Cinderella, but her hair is usually dark. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific character. Wait, could there be a Broadway show where a Disney princess is portrayed with red hair? For example, if a show is a parody or a different adaptation. But I'm not aware of any official Broadway productions where a Disney princess has red hair. \n\nSo, the answer would be no. Therefore, the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Hmm. First, I need to think about Disney princesses and which ones are on Broadway.\n\nI remember that Disney has several princesses, like Elsa from Frozen, Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Belle from Beauty and the Beast, Rapunzel from Tangled, and maybe others. Now, are any of these princesses portrayed in Broadway shows? \n\nThe Broadway version of Frozen is a thing, right? The musical \"Frozen\" is a Broadway show. Elsa is the main character there. But what color is her hair? In the movie, Elsa has long, flowing white hair. Wait, no, actually, in the movie, she has light blue hair? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. In the original Frozen, Elsa's hair is white with some blue streaks? Or is it just white? I think in the movie, her hair is white, but maybe in the Broadway show, they might have changed it for the stage. Or maybe not. Also, there's the Broadway show \"Beauty and the Beast,\" which features Belle. Belle's hair is brown, I believe. \n\nThen there's \"The Little Mermaid\" musical, which is also on Broadway. Ariel's hair is usually depicted as red in the movie, but on stage, maybe they have a different look. Wait, in the original movie, Ariel's hair is red, but in the Broadway show, maybe they have a different color. Wait, I'm not sure. I think in the Broadway version of The Little Mermaid, Ariel's hair is red, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, no, I think in the Broadway show, they might have kept the red hair. But then again, maybe not. \n\nWait, the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So if any of the Broadway shows feature a Disney princess with red hair, then the answer would be yes. Let me think of specific examples. \n\nIn the Broadway version of \"Frozen,\" Elsa's hair is white. In \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Belle has brown hair. In \"The Little Mermaid\" musical, Ariel's hair is red. So if Ariel is on Broadway, then yes. But wait, is the Broadway version of The Little Mermaid still running? I think it's been closed for a while. Let me check that. Wait, I might not have the most up-to-date information, but assuming that the Broadway show is still active, then Ariel would have red hair. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Broadway version of \"Tangled,\" but I don't think there's a Broadway show for Tangled. The original movie is Tangled, but the Broadway show might not be as prominent. \n\nSo, if there's a Broadway show that features a Disney princess with red hair, then the answer would be yes. But if none of the current Broadway shows have a Disney princess with red hair, then no. \n\nWait, in the original Little Mermaid, Ariel's hair is red. So if the Broadway show is based on that, then yes. However, I need to confirm if the Broadway version of The Little Mermaid has Ariel with red hair. Alternatively, maybe the Broadway version changes the hair color. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Broadway musical \"Cinderella,\" but that's not a princess? Wait, Cinderella is a princess, but the Broadway version might have her with different hair. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me try to recall. The Broadway show \"The Little Mermaid\" was a musical that ran from 1983 to 1992. In that show, Ariel's hair was red. However, the current Broadway productions might have different versions. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Broadway version of \"Frozen,\" where Elsa's hair is white. So if the question is about any Disney princess on Broadway, and if Ariel (from The Little Mermaid) is on Broadway, then yes, she has red hair. \n\nBut if the question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway (as in, any current one) has red hair, then maybe the answer is yes, because Ariel's character in The Little Mermaid musical has red hair. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no current Broadway show featuring a Disney princess with red hair. \n\nWait, the user is asking for a yes/no answer. So I need to decide based on the information. Since Ariel is a Disney princess with red hair, and if there's a Broadway show that features her, then the answer is yes. \n\nBut I'm not entirely certain about the current status of the Broadway show. However, the original Little Mermaid musical did have Ariel with red hair, so if the question is referring to that, then the answer would be yes. But if the user is considering only current shows, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no, because none of the current Broadway shows have a Disney princess with red hair. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. But given that the question is general, and assuming that the Broadway version of The Little Mermaid includes Ariel with red hair, the answer would be yes. However, if the user is referring to the current Broadway shows, perhaps the answer is no. \n\nBut since I don't have the most up-to-date information, I need to make an educated guess. Given that the original Little Mermaid musical had Ariel with red hair, and the question doesn't specify current shows, the answer might be yes. But I'm not 100% sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick. For example, maybe the Broadway version of Frozen has Elsa with white hair, and the Broadway version of Beauty and the Beast has Belle with brown hair, and the Little Mermaid's Broadway version has Ariel with red hair. So the answer would be yes. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes. But I need to check if there's any current Broadway show with a Disney princess with red hair. If not, then the answer would be no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because the Broadway versions of the Disney princesses don't have red hair. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. But given the information I have, I think the answer is yes, because Ariel's character in The Little Mermaid musical has red hair. So the decision is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall which Disney princesses are known for having red hair. The most obvious one is Rapunzel from Tangled. She has that iconic golden hair, which is actually a shade of red, right? Wait, golden hair is more like a light blonde, but maybe in some contexts, it's considered red. But then there's Mulan, who has black hair. Elsa from Frozen has white hair, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty has light blonde. Then there's Pocahontas, who has dark hair. Oh, and maybe Jasmine from Aladdin? She has dark hair too. \n\nWait, but the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So, does any of these princesses have a Broadway show? Tangled has a Broadway musical, right? The Tangled: The Musical. In that show, Rapunzel's hair is a key element. But the color of her hair in the musical is more golden or light blonde. However, the original Tangled movie had her hair as golden, which is a shade of red. Wait, but technically, golden hair is not red. Red hair is a specific shade. So if the question is about red hair, then Rapunzel's hair is golden, not red. So maybe the answer is no. \n\nBut maybe there's another Disney princess with red hair in a Broadway show. Let me think. There's also the Lion King, but that's not a Disney princess. The Little Mermaid has Ariel, who has dark hair. Snow White has light hair. Maybe the Broadway version of something else? Wait, the Disney princesses on Broadway might refer to specific productions. For example, \"Cinderella\" has been done on Broadway, but Cinderella's hair is usually blonde. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the character of the Disney princess in a Broadway show, but not necessarily the original princess. For example, if a Broadway show features a Disney princess character, but maybe in a different color. But I don't recall any Broadway show where a Disney princess is portrayed with red hair. \n\nWait, maybe the user is thinking of the movie Tangled and the Broadway musical. If the musical's Rapunzel has golden hair, which is not red, then the answer would be no. But maybe in some productions, they dye her hair red? That's possible, but the original design is golden. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confused between red hair and golden hair. If the question is asking if any Disney princess on Broadway has red hair, then the answer would be no. But if they consider golden as red, then maybe yes. However, in standard color terms, red and golden are different. So the answer would be false. Therefore, the decision is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" The user wants a yes/no answer in a JSON object. \n\nFirst, I need to recall which Disney princesses are known for having red hair. The most obvious one is Rapunzel from Tangled. She has bright red hair, which is a key feature of her character. But wait, is there a Broadway production of Tangled? I think there was a Broadway musical adaptation of Tangled, which opened in 2017. So Rapunzel would be part of that show. \n\nBut the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. Are there other Disney princesses with red hair? Let me think. Aurora from Sleeping Beauty has light blonde hair, Elsa from Frozen has white hair (though she can create ice, which might be a different context). Merida from Brave has red hair, but I'm not sure if there's a Broadway show featuring her. The Broadway version of Frozen is a musical, but Elsa isn't red-haired. \n\nSo the main one would be Rapunzel in the Tangled Broadway show. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I need to confirm if the Broadway version of Tangled actually features Rapunzel with red hair. Since the original movie has her with red hair, and the Broadway musical is based on the movie, it's safe to assume she has red hair there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different princess. But I don't recall any other Disney princess with red hair that's commonly known. So unless there's a different production or a new one that I'm not aware of, the answer should be yes. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is thinking of a specific production where a princess isn't the main character. However, the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway, so the main characters would be the ones we know. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, there is a Disney princess on Broadway (Rapunzel) with red hair. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" The user wants a yes/no answer in a JSON object. First, I need to figure out which Disney princesses are on Broadway. The most famous one is probably Elsa from Frozen, as the Broadway musical \"Frozen\" is a big hit. But wait, there's also \"Beauty and the Beast\" on Broadway, which features Belle. Then there's \"Cinderella,\" but I'm not sure if that's currently on Broadway. Let me check.\n\nWait, the user is asking specifically about a Disney princess on Broadway. So I need to consider which Disney princess characters are currently in Broadway shows. Let's think about the main ones. \n\nElsa from Frozen is a central character in the Broadway version of \"Frozen,\" which is a Disney musical. She has ice powers and her hair is blue, right? Wait, no, Elsa's hair is actually blonde in the movie. Wait, no, in the movie, Elsa has blonde hair, but in the Broadway show, does she have red hair? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up characters. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the question is about red hair. So, which Disney princess has red hair? The most obvious one is Red Riding Hood, but that's not a Disney princess. Wait, in Disney's \"Cinderella,\" the stepsisters have red hair. But Cinderella herself has a golden dress, but her hair is brown. Wait, maybe the princess with red hair is from \"The Little Mermaid\"? No, Ariel has blonde hair. Wait, maybe the answer is no, but I need to check.\n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to the Broadway show \"Cinderella,\" which is based on the Disney version. In that case, the princess is Cinderella, who has brown hair. But there's also the Broadway musical \"Beauty and the Beast,\" where Belle is the princess. She has brown hair. Then there's \"Frozen,\" where Elsa has blonde hair. So none of the Disney princesses on Broadway have red hair. Wait, unless there's another show. \n\nWait, maybe \"The Lion King\" is a Disney show, but the characters are not princesses. The main characters are Simba and Nala. Nala is a princess, but she's from the Pride Lands, not a traditional Disney princess. But she's a princess in the story. Wait, but the question is about Disney princesses. So maybe the answer is no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a character in a Broadway show that's a Disney princess with red hair. But I can't think of any. The main Disney princesses are Snow White, Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), Belle, Elsa, Cinderella, Ariel, Jasmine, etc. None of them have red hair. So if the Broadway show features these princesses, they would have their original hair colors. Therefore, the answer would be no. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a specific production where a character is portrayed with red hair. However, that's not standard. The question is general, so unless there's a specific show that changes the hair color, the answer would be no. \n\nSo, the answer is false. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" The user wants a yes/no answer in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to recall which Disney princesses are commonly associated with Broadway. The most famous one is Elsa from Frozen. She's a main character in the Broadway musical \"Frozen.\" Now, Elsa's hair is typically depicted as white with some blue streaks, right? Wait, no, actually, in the movie, her hair is white, but in the Broadway show, maybe there are changes? Or perhaps the user is thinking of another princess.\n\nAnother possibility is Rapunzel from Tangled. But Rapunzel has golden hair. Then there's Snow White, but she's more associated with the original Disney film and not necessarily a Broadway production. Wait, there's a Broadway musical called \"Cinderella,\" but the princess there is Cinderella, who has golden hair. \n\nWait, maybe the user is thinking of the Broadway musical \"Beauty and the Beast,\" where Belle is the princess. Belle has brown hair. So none of the main Disney princesses in Broadway shows have red hair. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different production or a specific character. Let me think. Are there any Disney princesses with red hair? The original Disney princesses include Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) with golden hair, Aurora is a princess, but she's not on Broadway. Then there's Jasmine from Aladdin, who has dark hair. Ariel from The Little Mermaid has dark hair. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to a specific character or a non-traditional Disney princess? Or perhaps a character from a different show? Or maybe a character in a Broadway production that's not the main princess? \n\nAlternatively, could there be a mistake in the question? For example, maybe the user is thinking of a character from a different franchise, like \"Frozen\" where Elsa has white hair, but maybe in some productions, they dye it red? That seems unlikely. \n\nSo, based on the main Disney princesses in Broadway musicals, none have red hair. Therefore, the answer would be \"no.\" So the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. First, I need to figure out which Disney princesses are currently on Broadway. I know that Disney has several stage adaptations, like \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Cinderella,\" and \"The Lion King.\" But wait, the question specifies a Disney princess, so I should focus on those princesses.\n\nLooking at the main Disney princesses, there's Snow White, Elsa from Frozen, Rapunzel, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Aurora, and others. Now, I need to check if any of these are currently in a Broadway show. \n\n\"The Lion King\" is a Broadway show based on the Disney movie, but Simba isn't a princess. \"Beauty and the Beast\" features Belle, who has blonde hair. \"Cinderella\" has Cinderella, who is typically depicted with dark hair. \"Frozen\" has Elsa and Anna; Elsa has ice blue hair, but Anna's hair is usually brown. \n\nWait, there's also \"Aladdin,\" but Jasmine is the princess there. She has dark hair. Are there any other Broadway shows with Disney princesses? Maybe \"Mulan\" or \"Pocahontas,\" but those are less common. \n\nI should also consider if any of these princesses have been portrayed with red hair in specific productions. For example, in some stage adaptations, characters might have different hair colors for visual reasons. But the original Disney princesses don't have red hair. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to a specific character. Let me think again. The main Disney princesses are Snow White (blonde), Elsa (blue), Rapunzel (blonde), Ariel (dark), Belle (blonde), Jasmine (dark), Aurora (blonde). None of them are red-haired in the original Disney movies. \n\nSo, unless there's a specific Broadway production that changes a character's hair color, the answer would be no. However, if there's a production where a princess is portrayed with red hair, that could be a case. But without specific information about a particular show, the general answer would be no. \n\nTherefore, the answer is false. There isn't a Disney princess on Broadway with red hair as per the original characters.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Hmm. First, I need to think about which Disney princesses are known for having red hair. The most famous ones are probably Snow White, whose hair is usually depicted as red or auburn. Then there's the Little Mermaid, Ariel, but she has blonde hair. Rapunzel from Tangled has golden hair. Cinderella has blonde hair, I think. Aurora from Sleeping Beauty has light hair. Then there's Elsa from Frozen, but she's not a traditional princess in the Disney canon. \n\nWait, but the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So maybe they're referring to a musical adaptation. For example, \"Beauty and the Beast\" is a Broadway show, and the character Belle is a Disney princess. Belle has brown hair, I believe. Snow White has been in some Broadway productions, like the 1994 revival. In those productions, the actress playing Snow White would have red hair. But is that the case in all productions? Maybe some productions might cast someone with different hair color. However, the question is general, not about a specific production. \n\nSo the key is whether there's a Disney princess on Broadway (as in, a character from a Disney princess movie that's performed on Broadway) that has red hair. Snow White is a Disney princess, and in the original Broadway version, the character is played with red hair. But if the question is about any current Broadway show, maybe it's not. Wait, the question isn't specific to a particular show. So if there exists at least one instance where a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair, then the answer would be yes. \n\nBut maybe the question is implying that the princess is currently on Broadway. For example, if there's a current Broadway show featuring a Disney princess with red hair. But I'm not sure about that. The original \"Snow White\" musical was on Broadway, and the lead actress had red hair. So in that case, the answer would be yes. However, if the question is asking whether all Disney princesses on Broadway have red hair, then the answer would be no. But the question is phrased as \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" which is a general yes/no question. So if there's at least one instance, the answer is yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the character's original design, not the actor's hair color. For example, Snow White's character is depicted with red hair, so if the Broadway show is based on the original Disney version, then the answer would be yes. But if the Broadway show is a different adaptation, maybe not. However, the question is not specific. \n\nSo considering the most well-known examples, the answer would be yes. Therefore, the decision is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to think about Disney princesses. The classic ones like Snow White, Ariel, Belle, etc. Snow White has blonde hair, Ariel has dark hair, Belle has brown hair. But wait, there's also Jasmine from Aladdin, who has dark hair. Then there's Elsa from Frozen, who has white hair. But wait, the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So maybe they're referring to a specific musical or production.\n\nWait, there's a Broadway musical called \"Disney's Beauty and the Beast,\" which is based on the Disney movie. In that production, Belle is the princess character. Belle's hair in the movie is brown, but on stage, maybe they changed it? Or maybe there's another production. Alternatively, there's \"The Lion King\" on Broadway, but that's not a Disney princess. \n\nAnother thought: Maybe the question is referring to a specific character. For example, in the original \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" the princess is Snow White with blonde hair. But if there's a Broadway adaptation, maybe they changed her hair color? But I don't recall any such changes. \n\nWait, maybe the user is thinking of a different princess. Let me think. There's also Pocahontas, but her hair is dark. Maybe the answer is no, because none of the classic Disney princesses have red hair. But wait, there's a character named Merida from \"Brave,\" who has red hair. However, Merida is not typically considered a princess in the same way as the others. She's a princess, but maybe the question is referring to the traditional ones. \n\nSo, if the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway, and considering that Merida is a princess but not in a Broadway show, then maybe the answer is no. However, if there's a Broadway show that features Merida, then maybe. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific production where a princess has red hair. For example, in some stage adaptations, they might change hair colors for costume reasons. But without specific information, I can't assume that. \n\nIn the absence of specific information about a Broadway production where a Disney princess has red hair, the answer would be no. Because the classic Disney princesses don't have red hair, and there's no widely known Broadway show that features a red-haired Disney princess.

But wait, there's also \"Beauty and the Beast\" with Belle, and maybe others like \"Cinderella\" or \"The Little Mermaid.\" \n\nNow, thinking about their hair colors. Elsa has ice powers and her hair is usually depicted as white or light blue in the movie, but on stage, maybe they use different colors for effect. Wait, no, in the actual Broadway show, Elsa's hair is actually white. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to a specific character. Let me check. In \"Frozen,\" Elsa's hair is white, not red. Belle from \"Beauty and the Beast\" has brown hair. Aurora from \"Sleeping Beauty\" has light brown hair. Rapunzel from \"Tangled\" has golden hair. The Little Mermaid, Ariel, has red hair. Wait, Ariel does have red hair in the movie. But is there a Broadway production of \"The Little Mermaid\"? I'm not sure. The Broadway version of \"The Little Mermaid\" was a musical, but I think it's not as prominent as Frozen. \n\nSo if the question is about any Disney princess on Broadway, then Ariel (from The Little Mermaid) would have red hair. But does the Broadway version of that musical have Ariel with red hair? I think in the original Disney movie, she has red hair, and the Broadway adaptation likely keeps that. However, I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of another princess. \n\nWait, but the answer could be yes if there's at least one Disney princess on Broadway with red hair. So if Ariel is on Broadway and has red hair, the answer is yes. But if the question is about a specific princess, like Elsa, then no. However, the question is general: \"a Disney princess on Broadway.\" So if any of them have red hair, the answer is yes. \n\nBut I need to confirm if Ariel is indeed on Broadway. The Broadway musical \"The Little Mermaid\" opened in 2023, so that's a possibility. In that case, Ariel would have red hair. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different production. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different princess. Let me think again. Are there other Disney princesses in Broadway shows? For example, \"Cinderella\" has been adapted, but Cinderella's hair is usually brown. So, if Ariel is on Broadway and has red hair, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, if none of the Broadway productions have a princess with red hair, then the answer is no. \n\nI think the key here is whether there's a Disney princess on Broadway with red hair. Since Ariel is a Disney princess with red hair, and if there's a Broadway production of \"The Little Mermaid,\" then the answer would be yes. However, I need to check if that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of \"Frozen\" and Elsa, but her hair isn't red. So, if there's a princess with red hair on Broadway, the answer is yes. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I'm not 100% certain.

But Merida isn't a traditional Disney princess, though she's a princess in the movie. Wait, the question says \"Disney princess on Broadway.\" So maybe they're referring to a stage production.\n\nWait, there's a Broadway musical called \"Cinderella,\" but I don't remember if the character has red hair. Or maybe \"Beauty and the Beast,\" but Belle is more of a brown hair. Then there's \"The Little Mermaid\" with Ariel, who has red hair. Oh, right! Ariel from The Little Mermaid has red hair. But is there a Broadway production where Ariel is portrayed with red hair? Or maybe the original Disney princesses like Snow White, who has blonde hair. \n\nWait, but the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. So perhaps the answer depends on whether a specific Broadway show has a character with red hair. For example, the Broadway version of \"The Little Mermaid\" might have Ariel with red hair. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific character in a Broadway show. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because the original Disney princesses don't have red hair. But Merida is a princess from Pixar, which is part of Disney, but maybe not considered a traditional Disney princess. So if the question is about traditional Disney princesses, then the answer would be no. However, if the Broadway show includes a character like Merida, then the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I think the question is more likely referring to the traditional Disney princesses. So, the answer is no. Wait, but Ariel does have red hair. So if there's a Broadway show featuring Ariel, then yes. But I'm not sure if the Broadway version of The Little Mermaid has her with red hair. Wait, in the original movie, Ariel has red hair, but in some adaptations, maybe they change it. However, the question is about the existence of such a princess on Broadway. So if there is a Disney princess on Broadway (like in a show) who has red hair, then the answer would be yes. \n\nBut the question is not specific about which princess. So maybe the answer is yes if there's at least one. For example, in the Broadway show \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Belle has brown hair. But in \"The Little Mermaid,\" Ariel has red hair. So if that show is on Broadway, then yes. But I need to check if the Broadway version of The Little Mermaid exists. Wait, there was a Broadway musical version of The Little Mermaid, which opened in 2007. In that show, Ariel is portrayed with red hair. So that would make the answer yes. But wait, the user might be referring to a specific instance. However, the question is general. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the original Disney princesses, and if the Broadway show uses a specific character. But the question is a bit ambiguous. However, the answer would depend on whether any Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Since Ariel is a Disney princess with red hair and there's a Broadway show featuring her, the answer would be yes. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is thinking of the original Disney princesses. Let me think again. Snow White is blonde, Cinderella is brown, Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) is blonde, Belle is brown, Jasmine is brown, Elsa (Frozen) is blonde. Merida has red hair but is from Pixar. So if the Broadway show includes Merida, then yes. But I'm not sure if there's a Broadway show with Merida. However, the user might be referring to the traditional Disney princesses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway, and none of the traditional ones have red hair.

For example, Rapunzel from Tangled has blonde hair, Elsa has icy blue hair, and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty has dark hair. Red hair isn't a common trait among the classic Disney princesses. However, in some adaptations or stage versions, the actors might have different hair colors. But the question is about the princess herself, not the actor. So unless there's a specific Broadway production where a princess is portrayed with red hair, the answer would be no.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is referring to the Broadway version of \"Frozen,\" which is a musical based on the movie. In the movie, Elsa has ice blue hair, but in the Broadway show, the actress playing Elsa might have different hair color.

Then there's \"Cinderella,\" but the main character is Cinderella, who has dark hair. \n\nSo, if the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway, and Merida hasn't been in a Broadway show yet, then perhaps the answer is no. Unless there's a specific production that includes a red-haired princess. But I don't recall any. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to a character that's a Disney princess but not in the traditional sense. Wait, the answer might depend on the specific show. For example, if there's a production that includes Merida, then yes. But as of now, I don't think there's a Broadway show featuring Merida. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be no.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Does a Disney princess on Broadway have red hair?\" The user wants a yes/no answer in a JSON object.\n\nFirst, I need to recall which Disney princesses are typically portrayed on Broadway. The most famous one is probably Elsa from \"Frozen,\" who's been in Broadway shows. But wait, there's also \"Beauty and the Beast\" with Belle, and \"Cinderella\" with Cinderella. Let me think about their hair colors.\n\nElsa from Frozen has ice-blue hair, right? She's known for her icy powers, so her hair color is blue. Then there's Belle from Beauty and the Beast, who has brown hair. Cinderella has blonde hair in the original, but sometimes adaptations might change that. Wait, but the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. Are there any other princesses in Broadway shows?\n\nAnother possibility is \"The Lion King,\" but that's more about Simba and not a Disney princess. Maybe \"Aladdin\" with Jasmine? But Jasmine's hair is usually brown or dark. Wait, in the Broadway version of Aladdin, Jasmine's hair is brown. So none of the main Disney princesses in Broadway shows have red hair. \n\nWait, could there be a different show or a lesser-known princess? For example, maybe a show that features a different princess like Aurora from Sleeping Beauty? But Aurora's hair is usually light brown or golden. I don't recall any Broadway show where a Disney princess has red hair. \n\nRed hair is less common among Disney princesses. The main ones have blue, brown, or blonde. So the answer would be no. Therefore, the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Hmm. First, I need to think about Disney princesses and their hair colors. The main ones are like Elsa from Frozen, Rapunzel, Aurora, Snow White, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, etc. Now, red hair is a specific trait. Let me recall each princess's appearance.\n\nElsa has white hair with some blue highlights, I think. Rapunzel has golden hair. Aurora has dark hair, maybe brown. Snow White has dark hair too. Ariel has dark hair, I believe. Belle from Beauty and the Beast has brown hair. Jasmine has dark hair as well. Wait, are there any Disney princesses with red hair? Maybe someone like Tiana from The Princess and the Frog? No, she has black hair. Oh, maybe the newer ones? Like Moana? She has dark hair too. Wait, what about the Disney princesses in the Broadway shows? For example, \"Cinderella\" on Broadway, the princess there is Cinderella, who has brown hair. Or \"Beauty and the Beast\" with Belle. Are there any Broadway productions that feature a Disney princess with red hair? \n\nWait, maybe there's a specific production. Let me think. There's a musical called \"The Little Mermaid\" on Broadway, which features Ariel. But her hair is dark. What about \"Frozen\" on Broadway? Elsa's hair is white. Maybe there's a different princess in a different show? Like, perhaps a character that's not the main princess but has red hair? Or maybe a different version? Wait, I'm not sure. Are there any known Broadway productions where a Disney princess is portrayed with red hair? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific instance. For example, maybe in a certain play or a character's portrayal. But I can't recall any. All the main Disney princesses I know don't have red hair. So the answer would be no. Therefore, the decision should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. Hmm. First, I need to think about which Disney princesses are known for having red hair. The most obvious one is Rapunzel from Tangled. She has that iconic golden hair, but wait, is that red? No, golden is a different color. Then there's Elsa from Frozen, but she has white hair with blue highlights. Maybe someone else?\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to a specific Broadway show. Let me think. There's a Broadway musical called \"Cinderella,\" but the main character's hair is usually brown. \"Sleeping Beauty\" has Aurora, whose hair is typically depicted as dark. What about \"The Little Mermaid\" with Ariel? She has red hair, right? Wait, Ariel's hair is usually shown as red or orangey-red in the movies. But does she appear in a Broadway show? The Broadway version of \"The Little Mermaid\" was a musical, and I think Ariel's hair is indeed red. But is she considered a Disney princess? Yes, she is a Disney princess.\n\nSo if there's a Broadway production featuring Ariel, then yes, she would have red hair. However, I should check if there's any other Disney princess on Broadway with red hair. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a specific instance. For example, in the \"Disney's Newsies\" musical, the characters are based on the movie, but the main characters like Jack and Katherine don't have red hair. \n\nWait, but the question is about a Disney princess specifically. So if Ariel is on Broadway in a show, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the question is more general. Are there any other Disney princesses with red hair? Let me think again. Snow White has dark hair, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty is dark, Elsa is white, Rapunzel is golden, Jasmine has dark hair, Belle has brown, Aurora again, etc. So the only one with red hair is Ariel. So if there's a Broadway show that features Ariel, then the answer is yes. But does the question imply that there is a current or any Disney princess on Broadway with red hair? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick. For example, maybe the Broadway show \"Beauty and the Beast\" has Belle, but her hair is brown. So unless there's a specific production where a Disney princess with red hair is cast, the answer would be no. However, if the question is asking in general, then the answer would depend on whether any such princess is on Broadway. But since the question is phrased as a general yes/no, I need to determine if there exists a Disney princess on Broadway with red hair. \n\nSince Ariel is a Disney princess and in the Broadway musical \"The Little Mermaid,\" which is a Disney show, and she has red hair, then the answer would be yes. Therefore, the answer should be true. Wait, but I need to confirm if \"The Little Mermaid\" Broadway show is considered as having a Disney princess. Yes, because it's based on the Disney movie.

Let's take \"Beauty and the Beast\" \u2013 the main princess there is Belle. Belle is typically depicted with blonde hair. Then there's \"Cinderella,\" where the princess is Cinderella herself, who is usually portrayed with dark hair, maybe brown or black. \n\nWait, but what about \"Tangled\"? Rapunzel has long blonde hair, but I don't think there's a Broadway version of that yet. The Lion King has Nala, who is a princess, but her hair is more of a dark brown or black color. \n\nAre there any other Disney princesses in Broadway shows? Maybe \"Frozen\" has Elsa, but I'm not sure if there's a Broadway production of that. Also, the original Disney princesses like Snow White, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, or Ariel from The Little Mermaid \u2013 are any of them in Broadway productions? \n\nWait, there's a show called \"Disney's Newsies\" which is based on the movie, but the main characters aren't princesses. Maybe \"Happily Ever After\" which is a show that includes various Disney characters, but I'm not certain. \n\nSo, considering the main princesses in Broadway shows, Belle (blonde), Cinderella (dark hair), Nala (dark hair), and maybe others. None of them are red-haired. But wait, is there a Disney princess with red hair? Let me think. The original Disney princesses: Snow White has blonde hair. Aurora is blonde. Ariel has dark hair. Jasmine is typically brown or black. Elsa has white hair. Rapunzel is blonde. So, I don't recall any Disney princess with red hair in their original portrayals. \n\nBut wait, maybe in some adaptations or different versions, they might have changed the hair color. For example, in some stage productions, characters might be stylized differently. However, the question is about a Disney princess on Broadway. If there's a specific production that features a princess with red hair, that would be a yes. But I don't think any of the main Disney princesses in Broadway shows have red hair. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a character that's not a traditional princess but is considered one in the show.

For example, \"Cinderella\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\" have been adapted for Broadway. Let me think about the characters in those. Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters have red hair in some versions, but the main character, Cinderella, usually has golden or brown hair. In the original Disney movie, her hair is more of a golden color. \n\nThen there's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" where Belle is the princess. Belle's hair is typically depicted as dark brown. The Beast's transformation includes a human form, but the princess here is Belle, not someone else. \n\nWait, are there other Disney princesses in Broadway shows? There's also \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"Aladdin,\" but I'm not sure if those have Broadway versions. The Broadway version of \"Aladdin\" has Jasmine, who has dark hair. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to a specific production.

So if the question is about a Disney princess (the main character), then maybe not. But if it's about any princess in the show, like the stepsisters, then yes. \n\nBut the question says \"a Disney princess,\" which might refer to the main princess character. So, in most cases, the main princesses in Broadway adaptations don't have red hair. However, I should check if there's any specific instance where a Disney princess on Broadway has red hair. \n\nWait, there's also the \"Tangled\" musical, which is a Broadway show. Rapunzel is the princess there. In the original movie, she has golden hair, but in the musical, her hair is often depicted as blonde. So that's not red. \n\nAnother possibility is the \"Sleeping Beauty\" musical, but I'm not sure about the details. The main princess is Aurora, whose hair is typically depicted as light brown or golden. \n\nSo, based on the main characters in the Broadway adaptations of Disney princess stories, none of them have red hair. The stepsisters in \"Cinderella\" might have red hair, but they are not the main princess. Therefore, the answer is likely no. However, I should be careful here. Are there any exceptions? Maybe a specific production where a princess has red hair? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different show. For example, the \"Frozen\" musical. Elsa is the princess, and in the movie, she has white hair, but in the musical, it's more of a platinum blonde.

None of the classic Disney princesses have red hair. However, there's a character named Merida from \"Brave\" who has red hair. But is there a Broadway show featuring Merida? The \"Brave\" musical is a Broadway show, and Merida is the main character. In the original movie, Merida has red hair.
