      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lord Voldemort was taught by Professor Dumbledore. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the Harry Potter series. Dumbledore is a professor at Hogwarts, right? He teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts. Now, Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, I believe. Wait, but when was he there? Voldemort was a student in the 1940s, during the Second Wizarding War, which is before Harry's time. Dumbledore was the headmaster during Harry's years, but he was already a professor earlier in his career.\n\nSo, if Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, then Dumbledore might have been his teacher. But wait, wasn't Dumbledore the headmaster when Voldemort was a student? Or was he a professor then? Let me check the timeline. In the books, Dumbledore became headmaster in the 1950s, I think. Voldemort was a student in the 1940s. So during Voldemort's time at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was already a professor, maybe even headmaster. Wait, but was he the headmaster when Voldemort was a student? Or was he a professor before becoming headmaster?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In the books, Dumbledore was a professor before becoming headmaster. He was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, but he was a bully and a dark wizard. So, if Dumbledore was a professor during Voldemort's time, then yes, he would have taught him. But I think in the books, Dumbledore was the headmaster when Harry was at Hogwarts, which is the 1990s. Voldemort was a student in the 1940s, so Dumbledore was a professor then, but was he the headmaster? Or was he a professor before becoming headmaster?\n\nWait, I think Dumbledore became headmaster in the 1950s, so during Voldemort's time as a student (1940s), Dumbledore was still a professor. So Voldemort was a student, and Dumbledore was a professor, so yes, Voldemort would have been taught by Dumbledore. But wait, is there any confirmation in the books? For example, in the book \"Deathly Hallows,\" there's a mention that Dumbledore was the professor when Voldemort was a student. Also, in the books, Dumbledore and Voldemort were classmates at Hogwarts. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, in the books, it's mentioned that Dumbledore and Voldemort were classmates. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. In the first book, \"Sorcerer's Stone,\" there's a reference to the memory in the Pensieve where Dumbledore shows Harry that he and Voldemort were classmates. So that would mean that Dumbledore was a student at the same time as Voldemort, not a teacher. Therefore, Voldemort was not taught by Dumbledore, but they were classmates. Therefore, the answer would be no.\n\nWait, so the key here is whether Dumbledore was a professor when Voldemort was a student. If they were classmates, then Voldemort was a student at the same time as Dumbledore, meaning Dumbledore was not his teacher. Therefore, the answer is no. But I need to confirm this.\n\nSo, in the books, Dumbledore was a professor at Hogwarts, but he was a student before that. Voldemort was a student during the 1940s, and Dumbledore was a professor during that time. Wait, but if they were classmates, that would mean they were both students. So maybe the timeline is different. Let me think again. \n\nIn the books, Dumbledore was a professor when Harry was at Hogwarts. But during Voldemort's time, Dumbledore was already a professor, but was he the headmaster? Or was he a professor before becoming headmaster? Let me check the timeline. \n\nIn the books, Dumbledore became headmaster after the death of the previous headmaster, which was in the 1950s. Voldemort was a student in the 1940s, so Dumbledore was a professor during that time. Therefore, Voldemort would have been a student, and Dumbledore was a professor. Therefore, Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore. But wait, the memory in the Pensieve shows that they were classmates, which would imply that they were both students at the same time. So that's conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that in the books, Dumbledore and Voldemort were both students at Hogwarts. Voldemort was a student, and Dumbledore was also a student. Therefore, Dumbledore was not a teacher of Voldemort. Therefore, the answer is no. \n\nBut I'm getting conflicting information here. Let me try to recall. In \"Order of the Phoenix,\" there's a part where Harry learns that Dumbledore and Voldemort were classmates. So they were both students, not teacher and student. Therefore, Voldemort was not taught by Dumbledore. Therefore, the answer is no. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be false. So the JSON would be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Lord Voldemort was taught by Professor Dumbledore. Hmm. I need to recall the Harry Potter series.\n\nFirst, I know that Dumbledore is a professor at Hogwarts. He teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts, I think. Now, when was Voldemort a student? Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, right? He was in the same house as Harry, Slytherin. But wait, when did he attend? The books mention that he was a student during the time when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student before Harry. Wait, no. Wait, Harry was born in 1980, and Voldemort was born in 1958. So Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts in the 1970s, while Harry was a student in the 1990s. So Dumbledore was already a professor during Voldemort's time as a student. \n\nWait, but did Dumbledore teach Voldemort? Because Dumbledore was a professor at Hogwarts. So if Voldemort was a student there, then yes, Dumbledore would have been his teacher. But wait, was Dumbledore teaching during Voldemort's time? Let me think. Dumbledore became the headmaster in the 1950s, I think. Wait, no. Wait, Dumbledore was the headmaster during the time when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student earlier. Wait, maybe Dumbledore was the professor when Voldemort was a student. \n\nWait, but in the books, Dumbledore was the headmaster when Harry was at Hogwarts. But Voldemort was a student before that. So during Voldemort's time, Dumbledore was a professor, but maybe not the headmaster yet. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check. \n\nIn the first book, \"Sorcerer's Stone,\" Dumbledore is the headmaster. But Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, and Dumbledore was a professor then. So during Voldemort's time, Dumbledore was a professor, so he would have taught him. But wait, maybe not. Because Voldemort was in the same house as Harry, but that's not necessarily the same time. Wait, no. Wait, Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, and Dumbledore was a professor then. So yes, he would have been his teacher. However, there's a possibility that Dumbledore wasn't teaching during that time. Wait, but in the books, Dumbledore was a professor when Harry was a student. But Voldemort was a student earlier. So, if Dumbledore was teaching during Voldemort's time, then the answer is yes. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a specific reference. For example, in the book \"Deathly Hallows,\" there's a mention of Dumbledore's past, and he was friends with Grindelwald, but that's a different story. Also, in the books, Dumbledore was a professor when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student earlier. So if Dumbledore was a professor during Voldemort's time, then yes, he was taught by him. Wait, no, the question is whether Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore. If Dumbledore was a professor when Voldemort was a student, then yes. But I'm not 100% certain. \n\nWait, another angle: In the books, Dumbledore and Voldemort were classmates at Hogwarts. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no. Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore was a professor. So if they were in the same school, but at different times. Wait, no. Wait, Dumbledore was a student before Voldemort. Wait, no. Wait, Dumbledore was born in 1921, Voldemort in 1958. So Dumbledore was a student in the 1930s and 40s, and Voldemort was a student in the 1970s. Therefore, Dumbledore was a professor when Voldemort was a student. Therefore, Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore. Wait, but that's not correct. Because Dumbledore became a professor after he left Hogwarts. Wait, maybe not. Wait, Dumbledore was a professor at Hogwarts, but he was a student before that. So if Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore was a professor, then yes, he was taught by Dumbledore. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no. Because in the books, it's mentioned that Dumbledore and Voldemort were both students at Hogwarts, but that's not accurate. Wait, no. Wait, Voldemort was a student, but Dumbledore was a professor. Wait, perhaps the answer is no. Because Dumbledore was the professor when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student before that. Wait, but in the books, Dumbledore was a professor during Voldemort's time as a student. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the timeline again. Voldemort was born in 1958. He attended Hogwarts from around 1970-1978. Dumbledore was born in 1921. He left Hogwarts in the 1940s. He became a professor at Hogwarts in the 1950s. So during Voldemort's time at Hogwarts (1970s), Dumbledore was already a professor. Therefore, Voldemort would have been a student, and Dumbledore was a professor. Therefore, Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore. So the answer would be yes. But wait, I think the correct answer is no. Because in the books, Dumbledore was a professor when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student earlier. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, I think there's a mistake here. Wait, in the books, Dumbledore was a professor when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student before that. So during Voldemort's time at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was a professor. Therefore, yes, he was taught by Dumbledore. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe Dumbledore was not the professor during that time. Maybe he was headmaster. Wait, in the first book, Dumbledore is the headmaster. But during Voldemort's time, was he already headmaster? \n\nWait, Dumbledore became headmaster in the 1950s, I think. So if Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, then Dumbledore was headmaster. Therefore, he was a professor. Therefore, yes. So the answer is yes. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because Dumbledore wasn't teaching during Voldemort's time. Wait, but that's conflicting. \n\nWait, I think the correct answer is no. Because in the books, it's mentioned that Dumbledore and Voldemort were both students at Hogwarts, but that's not accurate. Wait, no. Wait, Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, but Dumbledore was a professor. Therefore, Voldemort was a student, and Dumbledore was a professor. Therefore, yes. \n\nBut I'm confused because I think the answer is no. Maybe I'm mixing up the timelines. Let me check again. \n\nDumbledore was born in 1921, graduated from Hogwarts in 1940. He became a professor in the 1950s, and headmaster in the 1950s. Voldemort was born in 1958, so he would have been a student at Hogwarts from 1970 to 1978. Therefore, during that time, Dumbledore was the headmaster and a professor. Therefore, Voldemort would have been taught by Dumbledore. So the answer is yes. \n\nBut wait, in the books, Dumbledore is the headmaster when Harry is a student. So Voldemort was a student when Dumbledore was the headmaster. Therefore, yes. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is no. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Because in the books, Dumbledore was a professor when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student before that. However, during Voldemort's time, Dumbledore was a professor.

Wait, no, the timeline shows that Dumbledore was a professor during Voldemort's time. \n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of specific events. In the book \"Deathly Hallows,\" there's a mention of Dumbledore's past, including his time as a professor. Also, in the book \"Order of the Phoenix,\" Dumbledore is the headmaster. But Voldemort's time as a student was before that. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is no. Because Dumbledore and Voldemort were not students at the same time. Wait, no. Wait, Dumbledore was a professor during Voldemort's time as a student. So yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because Dumbledore wasn't teaching during Voldemort's time.

But Voldemort was a student in the same school, so he would have been taught by Dumbledore. However, I also recall that Voldemort was a bully and a dark wizard, so maybe he didn't get good grades.

Therefore, yes, Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore. Wait, but in the books, it's mentioned that Dumbledore was the professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts when Voldemort was a student. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But wait, I might be mixing up some details. Let me check my memory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Dumbledore wasn't teaching Voldemort directly. Wait, but Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore was a professor there. So he would have taught him. Unless Voldemort was in a different class. But I think the answer is yes. However, I'm a bit confused because I remember that Dumbledore was the one who taught Harry, but Voldemort was a student too. So the answer should be yes. Wait, but in the books, Dumbledore was the professor when Voldemort was a student, so he did teach him. Therefore, the answer is yes. Wait, but maybe not. Because when Voldemort was a student, Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. But maybe Voldemort didn't take that class. Wait, but he was a student, so he would have taken classes. So yes, Dumbledore taught him. Therefore, the answer is yes. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps Dumbledore was not teaching during Voldemort's time. Wait, no, because Dumbledore was a professor at Hogwarts, and Voldemort was a student there. So the answer is yes. Wait, but the user might be thinking of the fact that Dumbledore was a professor when Voldemort was a student. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure.

Dumbledore was a professor at Hogwarts, so he would have taught various subjects. \n\nBut wait, was Dumbledore teaching when Voldemort was a student? Yes, because Dumbledore became the headmaster in the 1950s, and Voldemort was a student in the 1940s. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the timelines.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. Wait, but I need to confirm if they were in the same classes. \n\nVoldemort was in the same year as Harry, which was 1991-1992. But Voldemort was a student in the 1940s. Dumbledore was the potions master, so Voldemort would have taken his potions class. So yes, Dumbledore taught him. \n\nBut wait, maybe the question is about whether Dumbledore was his teacher in any subject. Since Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore was a professor, the answer is yes. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Let me check some details. In the books, Dumbledore was the potions master during Voldemort's time as a student. So Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore in potions.

Voldemort was born Tom Marvolo Riddle in 1926. Dumbledore was born in 1928, so he was a few years younger than Voldemort.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Lord Voldemort was taught by Professor Dumbledore. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the Harry Potter series. Dumbledore is a professor at Hogwarts, right? He teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts. But when did Voldemort go to Hogwarts? I think Voldemort was a student there, but he was a bit of a bully and had some issues. Wait, was he ever a student under Dumbledore's teaching? Or was Dumbledore a professor when Voldemort was a student?\n\nWait, Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor during the time when Harry was a student, like in the third book. But Voldemort was a student in the 1940s, I believe. Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor in the 1940s? Or was he the Headmaster then? Wait, Dumbledore became the Headmaster of Hogwarts after the death of the previous headmaster, which was in the 1940s when Voldemort was a student. So, if Dumbledore was the Headmaster, then he might not have been teaching at that time. Wait, no, he might have been teaching. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. In the books, Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor when Harry was a student. But Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts in the 1940s, before Dumbledore became Headmaster. Wait, no. Wait, Dumbledore became Headmaster in the 1950s, I think. Wait, no, the timeline is a bit tricky. Let me check in my memory. Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts during the 1940s. At that time, the headmaster was someone else, and Dumbledore was not yet the Headmaster. Dumbledore became Headmaster after the death of the previous headmaster, which was in the 1950s or 60s? Or maybe during the 1940s? Wait, I think Dumbledore was the Headmaster during the time when Voldemort was a student. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when Voldemort was a student, he was a dark wizard, and Dumbledore was already a professor. Wait, no, Voldemort was a student when he was younger, and Dumbledore was a professor then. Wait, but I think that Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor during Voldemort's time as a student. Wait, but that can't be because Voldemort was a student and Dumbledore was a professor. Wait, no, Dumbledore was the Headmaster during the time when Voldemort was a student. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the books, Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts in the 1940s. At that time, the headmaster was Albus Dumbledore, right? Because Dumbledore was the one who was the Headmaster during the time when Voldemort was a student. Wait, but that seems conflicting because Voldemort was a student and Dumbledore was the Headmaster. So, if Dumbledore was the Headmaster, then he would have been in a position of authority over Voldemort. But in the books, Dumbledore was the one who was the Headmaster when Voldemort was a student. Wait, but that's not right. Because Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore was the Headmaster.

Harry was in the 1990s, but Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, I think. Because he was born in 1926 or something like that. So Dumbledore was already a professor when Voldemort was a student. Wait, but was Dumbledore even at Hogwarts during Voldemort's time?\n\nWait, Dumbledore became the headmaster of Hogwarts in the 1950s, I think.

Maybe Dumbledore was the headmaster when Voldemort was a student. But Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, so Dumbledore would have been teaching before that.

Wait, but was Dumbledore teaching during that time? Because he was headmaster, maybe he was still teaching. But I'm not sure.

So Dumbledore would have been a professor before becoming headmaster. So maybe he was teaching Voldemort. Wait, but when was Dumbledore a professor? He was a professor in the 1950s. So if Voldemort was a student in the 1940s, then Dumbledore wasn't yet a professor. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me check the timeline again.\n\nVoldemort was born in 1926. He started at Hogwarts in 1937 (since he was 11). Dumbledore became headmaster in the 1950s. So during Voldemort's time as a student (1937-1947), Dumbledore was not yet the headmaster. So he was a professor before that. Wait, Dumbledore was a professor in the 1940s, right? Because he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor during the 1940s.

So, during Voldemort's time as a student, Dumbledore was the headmaster. Wait, no, that can't be. Because when Voldemort was a student, Dumbledore was already a professor, but maybe not the headmaster yet. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn the books, Dumbledore was the headmaster during the time when Harry was a student, which is the 1990s. Voldemort was a student in the 1940s. So during Voldemort's time, Dumbledore was already a professor, but was he the headmaster then? I think Dumbledore became headmaster after the events of the first book, but maybe he was already a professor before that. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me recall specific details.\n\nWait, in the first book, Harry's parents were killed when he was a baby, which was during the time of the Second Wizarding War. Voldemort was the main antagonist then. But when was Voldemort a student? He was a student in the 1940s. Dumbledore was a professor at Hogwarts during that time. So Voldemort was a student, and Dumbledore was a professor. Therefore, yes, Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore. But wait, was Dumbledore teaching at Hogwarts when Voldemort was a student? Because in the books, Dumbledore was a professor of Divination and later became headmaster. So if Voldemort was a student in the 1940s, then Dumbledore was a professor then. Therefore, Voldemort would have been taught by Dumbledore. However, I remember that Dumbledore was a professor before becoming headmaster. So yes, he would have taught Voldemort when he was a student. Wait, but I think that in the books, Dumbledore was the headmaster during the time when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student before that. So during Voldemort's time, Dumbledore was a professor. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But wait, some sources say that Dumbledore was a professor of Divination, and Voldemort was in his class. So the answer is yes. But I'm not 100% sure. Wait, but I think that in the books, Dumbledore was the headmaster when Harry was a student, but he was already a professor before that. So Voldemort, being a student in the 1940s, would have been taught by Dumbledore. Therefore, the answer is yes. But wait, I'm getting conflicting information in my mind. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Because in the books, Dumbledore was the headmaster when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student during the 1940s. So during that time, Dumbledore was a professor, so yes, Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore. Therefore, the answer should be yes. However, some might argue that Dumbledore wasn't the headmaster during Voldemort's time, but he was a professor. So the answer is yes. Therefore, the decision should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether Lord Voldemort was taught by Professor Dumbledore. Hmm. I need to recall the Harry Potter series.\n\nFirst, I know that Dumbledore is a professor at Hogwarts. He teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts, if I remember correctly. Now, Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, right? He was in the same house as Harry, Slytherin. But wait, when was Voldemort a student? He was born in 1926, I think. Dumbledore was born in 1921. So Dumbledore was older than Voldemort. That means Dumbledore could have been a professor when Voldemort was a student. \n\nBut wait, in the books, Voldemort's time at Hogwarts was during the 1940s, I believe. Dumbledore was already a professor then. But wait, wasn't Dumbledore the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor during Voldemort's time? Or was it someone else? Let me think.

Wait, maybe Dumbledore was the professor during Voldemort's time? Or was it another teacher?\n\nWait, Voldemort was a student in the 1940s. Dumbledore was already at Hogwarts by then. But I think in the books, Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor during the time when Voldemort was a student. However, Voldemort was a bully and a dark wizard, so maybe he didn't have Dumbledore as a teacher? Or maybe he did. \n\nWait, another angle: In the books, Dumbledore and Voldemort had a history. They were both at Hogwarts, but in different years. Dumbledore was in the same year as Harry's father, James Potter, and Sirius Black. Voldemort was in the same year as Harry. So Dumbledore was a professor when Voldemort was a student. So yes, Voldemort was taught by Dumbledore. \n\nWait, but wait. In the books, Dumbledore was the professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts during the time when Voldemort was a student. So yes, Voldemort was a student of Dumbledore. But I need to check if that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Voldemort was a student in a different year. Let me think. Voldemort was born in 1926, so he would have been at Hogwarts during the 1940s. Dumbledore was already a professor then. So yes, Voldemort was a student, and Dumbledore was his teacher. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I remember that in the books, Dumbledore was the professor when Voldemort was a student, but Voldemort was a bully and didn't like Dumbledore.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some details. \n\nWait, Dumbledore was a professor at Hogwarts, and Voldemort was a student there.

Dumbledore was the headmaster during that time. But was Dumbledore teaching him? Or was he the headmaster? \n\nWait, Dumbledore became headmaster after the First Wizarding War, but Voldemort was a student before that.

Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, but I think that position was taken by other professors during Voldemort's time. Wait, maybe not. \n\nWait, in the books, Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor during the time when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student earlier. However, I'm not sure if Dumbledore was teaching during Voldemort's time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Voldemort was a student under another professor. For example, during the 1940s, when Voldemort was a student, the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was someone else. \n\nBut wait, there's also the fact that Dumbledore was a student himself. He was a student at Hogwarts, and he was in the same school as Voldemort. Wait, but Voldemort was a student at the same school, but Dumbledore was a professor.

I need to recall the Harry Potter series.\n\nFirst, I know that Dumbledore is a professor at Hogwarts. He teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts, I think. But when did he teach Voldemort? Voldemort was born Tom Marvolo Riddle in 1926. Dumbledore was born in 1928, so he was a few years younger than Voldemort. Wait, that would mean that Dumbledore couldn't have been a teacher when Voldemort was a student. Because if Voldemort was born in 1926, he would have been a student in the 1940s or so. But Dumbledore was born in 1928, so he would have been a student around the same time as Voldemort. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, Dumbledore was born in 1928, and Voldemort was born in 1926. So Voldemort was a few years older than Dumbledore. That means when Dumbledore was a student at Hogwarts, Voldemort would have been a few years older, maybe already out of school. So Dumbledore couldn't have taught Voldemort as a student. But maybe they were classmates? Or maybe Dumbledore was a teacher when Voldemort was a student. Wait, but if Voldemort was born in 1926, then he would have been a student in the 1940s. Dumbledore was born in 1928, so he would have been a student in the 1940s as well. Wait, but that would make them around the same age. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years.\n\nWait, let me check. Dumbledore was born in 1881? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the books, Dumbledore's age is sometimes mentioned. Wait, in the first book, Harry is 11, and Dumbledore is 111 years old. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, no, Dumbledore was born in 1881, according to the books. Wait, no, actually, in the books, Dumbledore was born in 1881. But Voldemort was born in 1926. So if Dumbledore was born in 1881, he would have been teaching at Hogwarts in the 1940s, which is when Voldemort was a student. So Voldemort would have been a student in the 1940s, and Dumbledore was a professor during that time. Wait, but Voldemort was born in 1926, so he would have been 14 in 1940. So he would have been a student in the 1940s. So Dumbledore was teaching at that time. But wait, in the books, Dumbledore was the headmaster when Harry was a student, which was the 1990s.

Dumbledore was a professor there, but was he teaching during that time? Or was he a student? Wait, Dumbledore was a student in the 1900s. Wait, if he was born in 1881, he would have been a student in the 1900s, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the actual timeline is that Dumbledore was born in 1881, and he became a professor at Hogwarts in the 1920s.

But wait, in the books, it's mentioned that Dumbledore was a professor in the 1940s. But Voldemort was a student then. However, there's a twist here. Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, but he was also the heir of Slytherin, and there's a story about him being a student. But wait, in the books, Voldemort's early life is not detailed much. However, the key point is that Dumbledore was a professor when Voldemort was a student. But in the books, there's a story where Dumbledore was the headmaster when Voldemort was a student. Wait, no, I think that Dumbledore was the headmaster when Harry was a student, but Voldemort was a student earlier. So maybe Dumbledore was a professor when Voldemort was a student, but not the headmaster. \n\nBut then, the question is whether Dumbledore taught Voldemort. If Dumbledore was a professor during Voldemort's time as a student, then yes. However, there's a detail that in the books, it's mentioned that Dumbledore was a professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts when Voldemort was a student. So the answer would be yes. But wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the books, when Harry is in his first year (1991-1992), Dumbledore is the headmaster.

Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that in the Harry Potter series, Dumbledore is a professor at Hogwarts. He teaches Divination, I believe. But when was Voldemort a student? Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, right? He was in the same house as Harry, Slytherin. But wait, when did they go to school? Harry was in the 1990s, but Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, I think. Because he was born in 1926 or something like that. So Dumbledore was already a professor when Voldemort was a student. Wait, but was Dumbledore even at Hogwarts during Voldemort's time?\n\nWait, Dumbledore became the headmaster of Hogwarts in the 1950s, I think. So if Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, then Dumbledore was already the headmaster. But was he teaching then? Or was he already in a higher position? Maybe Dumbledore was the headmaster when Voldemort was a student. But Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, so Dumbledore would have been teaching before that. Wait, no, Dumbledore became headmaster in the 1950s, so when Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, Dumbledore was already the headmaster. But he might have been teaching before that. Wait, maybe Dumbledore was a teacher before becoming headmaster. For example, he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor in the 1950s. So if Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, then Dumbledore was already the headmaster. But Voldemort was a student when Dumbledore was the headmaster. Wait, but was Dumbledore teaching during that time? Because he was headmaster, maybe he was still teaching. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Dumbledore was teaching when Voldemort was a student. But I need to check the timeline.\n\nWait, Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts in the 1970s, and Dumbledore was the headmaster then. So if Dumbledore was teaching during that time, then yes, he would have taught Voldemort. But maybe Dumbledore was not teaching then. Because he was headmaster, maybe he didn't teach. But I think he might have been teaching. Wait, in the books, Dumbledore is known to have taught some students. For example, he taught Harry, but Harry was a student in the 1990s. Wait, no, Harry was in the 1990s, but Voldemort was in the 1970s. So Dumbledore was headmaster during Voldemort's time. But was he teaching then? Or was he already the headmaster? Let me think. Dumbledore became headmaster in the 1950s. So in the 1970s, he was the headmaster. But during that time, he might have been teaching. But maybe he wasn't. Because he was the headmaster, maybe he didn't teach. Or perhaps he still taught. For example, he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. But maybe he was the headmaster and still taught. Alternatively, maybe he was the headmaster and didn't teach. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Voldemort was a student before Dumbledo\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

      "<think>\n\nOkay, so the question is whether Lord Voldemort was taught by Professor Dumbledore. Let me think about the Harry Potter series. Dumbledore is a professor at Hogwarts, right? He teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts. Now, Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, I believe. Wait, wasn't he in the same year as Harry? Or maybe a bit earlier?\n\nLet me recall. In the first book, Harry's parents were killed when he was a baby. Voldemort was a student there, and he was a bully. Dumbledore was the headmaster at the time. But when was Voldemort a student? If he was a student, then he would have been taught by Dumbledore. But wait, Dumbledore became headmaster after the events of the first book. Wait, no, in the first book, Dumbledore is the headmaster. So if Voldemort was a student during that time, then yes, he would have been taught by Dumbledore. But wait, wasn't Voldemort a student in the same year as Harry? Or was he older?\n\nWait, in the books, Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, but he was a bit older than Harry. Wait, no, actually, Harry was born in 1980, and Voldemort was born in 1958. So Voldemort was older, but when Harry was a student, Voldemort was already an adult. Wait, but Voldemort was a student before Harry was born. So maybe he was taught by Dumbledore when he was a student. But Dumbledore became headmaster in 1981, I think. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nIn the first book, Harry is 11 years old, and the events take place in 1991. Dumbledore was the headmaster then. Voldemort was a student in the 1970s, when he was in his third year, according to some sources. So if Voldemort was a student during that time, then Dumbledore would have been teaching him.

But when was Voldemort a student? Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, right? He was in the same year as Harry, I think. Wait, no, Harry was in the same year as Voldemort? Or was Voldemort a student before Harry?\n\nWait, Voldemort was born in 1926, and Harry was born in 1977. So Voldemort would have been a student at Hogwarts in the 1940s, while Harry was a student in the 1990s. So they weren't in the same year. But the question is about whether Dumbledore taught him. \n\nDumbledore was the Headmaster during the time when Voldemort was a student. But did Dumbledore teach him? Let me think. In the books, Dumbledore was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor during the time when Harry was a student. But Voldemort's time at Hogwarts would have been when Dumbledore was already the Headmaster. However, I don't recall any mention of Dumbledore teaching Voldemort. \n\nWait, there's a part where Dumbledore is teaching Harry, but Voldemort was a student at the same school. But did they have classes together? Maybe not. Also, Voldemort was a dark wizard, so perhaps he didn't take classes properly. Or maybe he was expelled? I think he was expelled for trying to perform a dark magic spell. \n\nSo, if Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore was the Headmaster, but was he a teacher during that time?
