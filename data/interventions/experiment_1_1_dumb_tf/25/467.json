      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to recall who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of actor Johnny Depp and his first wife, Shelley Duvall. So her father is Johnny Depp. Now, the question is about cousins on her father's side. That would mean looking at Johnny Depp's family.\n\nI know that Johnny Depp has a daughter named Lily Rose Depp from his marriage to Virginia Allen. But wait, that's his daughter, not a cousin. Wait, cousins are children of your aunts or uncles. So if Zelda's father (Johnny) has siblings, then their children would be Zelda's cousins. But if Johnny doesn't have siblings, then there would be no cousins on that side.\n\nWait, I think Johnny Depp was an only child. Let me check that. From what I remember, Johnny Depp's parents were John Christopher Depp Jr. and Mary Anne Depp. I'm not sure if they had other children. If Johnny was an only child, then he wouldn't have any siblings, so no cousins from his side. But maybe there's more to it. For example, if his parents had other children who are not Johnny, but that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a step-cousin or something, but the question specifically says cousins on her father's side, which would be biological. So if Johnny Depp had no siblings, then Zelda Williams wouldn't have any cousins on her father's side. \n\nWait, I should verify if Johnny Depp has any siblings. Let me think. I recall that Johnny Depp's mother, Mary Anne Depp, was a model and had other children? Or was he an only child? I think he was an only child. So if that's true, then Zelda's father has no siblings, meaning no cousins on that side. Therefore, the answer would be false. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there's some family details I'm missing. Alternatively, perhaps there's a half-cousin if Johnny has a half-brother or sister from a different parent. But again, I don't think that's the case. \n\nSo based on the information I have, the answer is no. Zelda Williams doesn't have any cousins on her father's side.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to recall who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. So her father is Michael Jackson, and her mother is Lisa Marie Presley. \n\nNow, the question is about cousins on her father's side. That means we need to look at Michael Jackson's family. Let's think about Michael's relatives. His father was Joseph Jackson, and Joseph had several children, including Michael, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and the youngest, Randy. So Michael's siblings are Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy. \n\nZelda's father is Michael Jackson, so her cousins would be the children of Michael's siblings. So, if any of Michael's brothers or sisters have children, those would be Zelda's cousins. Let me check. \n\nJackie Jackson has children, like Jordan Jackson and Treci Waters. Tito Jackson has kids too, like Tito Jr. and others. Jermaine Jackson has children named Jymel and others. Marlon Jackson has a daughter named Jazmine. Randy Jackson also has children. So, if any of these siblings have children, then Zelda would have cousins through her father's side. \n\nBut wait, the question is about cousins on her father's side. So, if any of Michael's siblings have children, those would be Zelda's cousins. For example, Jackie's children would be Zelda's cousins. So yes, she would have cousins on her father's side. \n\nBut I need to make sure that these cousins are actually related. Let me confirm. Since Michael Jackson is her father, and his siblings are her uncles/aunts, their children are her cousins. Therefore, Zelda would have cousins from her father's side. \n\nSo the answer should be yes. Therefore, the JSON object would be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. Let me start by recalling who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of Warren Beatty and actress Shirley MacLaine. Wait, no, actually, I think she's the daughter of Warren Beatty and his first wife, actress Diane Keaton. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up some details here. Let me check.\n\nWait, Zelda Williams is the daughter of Warren Beatty and his first wife, Diane Keaton. Wait, but Diane Keaton and Warren Beatty were married from 1975 to 1982. They had a daughter named Zelda Williams. So her father is Warren Beatty, and her mother is Diane Keaton. Now, the question is about her father's side, so that would be Warren Beatty's family.\n\nSo, to find out if Zelda has cousins on her father's side, we need to look into Warren Beatty's siblings. If Warren Beatty has any brothers or sisters, then Zelda would have cousins through her father's side. Let me think about Warren Beatty's family. I remember that Warren Beatty has a brother named Philip Beatty. Philip was an actor as well, though I think he passed away in the early 2000s. So if Warren has a brother, then Zelda would have a cousin from her father's side. \n\nWait, but I should verify if Philip Beatty is indeed Warren's brother. Let me think. Warren Beatty was born in 1938, and Philip Beatty was born in 1937. So they are twins? Wait, no, I think they are brothers but not twins. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to recall. Warren Beatty's brother is named Philip Beatty. Philip was an actor and a director. He died in 2000. So if Warren has a brother, then Zelda would have a cousin through her father's side. Therefore, the answer would be yes, she has a cousin on her father's side, which is Philip Beatty's children. But wait, did Philip Beatty have any children? If Philip had children, then Zelda would have cousins. However, I'm not sure if Philip had any kids. Let me think. I think Philip Beatty was married to a woman named Barbara, and they had a daughter named Barbara Beatty. So if that's the case, then Zelda would have a cousin named Barbara Beatty. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Warren Beatty doesn't have any siblings. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should check. Wait, Warren Beatty's father was a businessman, and his mother was a socialite. I think Warren had a brother named Philip, but I'm not 100% certain. If there's any doubt here, maybe I should consider that. However, based on what I know, Warren Beatty does have a brother named Philip, so that would mean Zelda has a cousin on her father's side. Therefore, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Philip Beatty didn't have any children. If that's the case, then Zelda wouldn't have any cousins from that side. However, if Philip had children, then yes. Since I don't remember if Philip had children, I might need to make an educated guess. Alternatively, maybe there's another sibling. Wait, I think Warren Beatty's mother had other children? Or maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about whether there are any cousins, regardless of whether they are alive or not. So even if Philip had a child, that would count. But if Philip didn't have any children, then no. \n\nBut given that I'm not certain about Philip's children, maybe I should check another angle. Let me think. If Zelda Williams has a cousin on her father's side, that would require Warren Beatty to have a sibling. If Warren Beatty has no siblings, then the answer is no. \n\nSo, I need to confirm whether Warren Beatty has any siblings. From what I remember, Warren Beatty has a brother named Philip. So if that's the case, then Zelda would have a cousin through her father's side. Therefore, the answer should be yes. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me try to recall. Warren Beatty's brother, Philip, was an actor and director. He died in 2000. So if Philip had children, then yes. However, if he didn't, then no. Since I don't remember if Philip had children, maybe I should check. Wait, perhaps I can think of any known cousins of Zelda. For example, if there's any public information about Zelda's family, but I don't recall any. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because Warren Beatty doesn't have any siblings. But I think he does have a brother. So I'm leaning towards yes. Therefore, the answer would be true. But I'm not 100% sure. However, given the information I have, I'll go with yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to recall who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine, right? So her father is Warren Beatty. Now, the question is about cousins on her father's side. That means we need to look into Warren Beatty's family.\n\nI know Warren Beatty has a daughter named Francesca Beatty, who is Zelda's half-sister. But wait, that's from his marriage to actress Diane Keaton. But the question is about cousins. So cousins would be the children of Warren's siblings. So I need to check if Warren Beatty has any siblings. If he does, then their children would be Zelda's cousins.\n\nI remember that Warren Beatty's father was a businessman, and his mother was a teacher. I think Warren had a brother named David Beatty, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again. There's a possibility that Warren Beatty's father had other children. If Warren's father had a brother or sister, then their children would be Warren's cousins, making them Zelda's cousins as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Warren Beatty's mother had siblings. But the question is specifically about the father's side. So we need to focus on Warren's parents' siblings. If Warren's father had siblings, then their children would be Zelda's cousins. \n\nWait, I think Warren Beatty's father was named George Beatty, and he had a brother named Edward Beatty. So Edward Beatty would be Warren's uncle. If Edward had children, then those would be Warren's cousins, hence Zelda's cousins. But I'm not sure if Edward Beatty had any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Warren Beatty's father had other siblings. I need to check. Let me try to recall. From what I remember, Warren Beatty's father, George Beatty, had a brother named Edward Beatty. If Edward had children, then those children would be Warren's cousins. However, I'm not certain if Edward had any kids. \n\nWait, I think Edward Beatty was a businessman and a former governor of California. If he had children, they would be cousins. But I'm not sure about that. Maybe there's no information on that. Alternatively, maybe Warren Beatty's father had other siblings, but I can't recall. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Warren Beatty's mother had siblings. But again, the question is about the father's side. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps Zelda's father's cousins are from his father's side. So if Warren's father had siblings, their children would be cousins. \n\nBut I'm not certain if Warren Beatty has any cousins. If there's no information about his father's siblings, then the answer might be no. However, I might be missing something. \n\nWait, another angle: Zelda's father is Warren Beatty, and if he has any siblings, their children would be cousins. But Warren Beatty's siblings? I think he has a half-brother from his father's side. Wait, Warren Beatty's father had a son with another woman, but I don't think that's the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Warren Beatty's father had a brother, and that brother's children would be cousins. But again, without specific info, it's hard. \n\nWait, I think the answer is that Zelda Williams does have cousins on her father's side. For example, if Warren Beatty's father had a brother, then that brother's children would be cousins. However, I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Warren Beatty's father had a son, making that son a brother to Warren, hence their children would be cousins. But if Warren's father had a brother, then that brother's children would be cousins. \n\nWait, I think Warren Beatty's father was George Beatty, and George had a brother named Edward Beatty. Edward Beatty was a politician. If Edward had children, then those would be cousins. However, I'm not sure if Edward had any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no known information about Warren Beatty having any cousins. So the answer might be false. \n\nBut I'm not certain. I think the answer is that Zelda Williams does have cousins on her father's side, but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, maybe I should look up some information. But since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on my memory. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps Warren Beatty's father had a brother, and that brother's children are cousins. So the answer would be yes. But if there's no such siblings, then no. \n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here. Given that Warren Beatty's father had at least one brother, and assuming that brother had children, then yes. Otherwise, no. \n\nBut I'm not certain. Maybe the answer is false. However, I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a possibility that Warren Beatty's father had no siblings, so no cousins. \n\nI think I need to conclude based on what I know. If I can't confirm, maybe the answer is false. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, another angle: Zelda's father, Warren Beatty, has a half-sister from his mother's side. Wait, no, the question is about the father's side. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Warren Beatty's father had a brother, making that brother's children cousins. If that's the case, then yes. \n\nBut without specific information, I might have to say that the answer is false. However, I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no known cousins on Warren Beatty's side, so the answer is no. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, I might have to state that the answer is false. However, I'm not confident. \n\nWait, I think the answer is yes. Because Warren Beatty's father, George Beatty, had a brother named Edward Beatty. If Edward had children, then those children would be cousins. So the answer is yes. But I'm not sure if Edward had children. \n\nBut since I don't have that information, maybe I should say that there's no confirmation, so the answer is false. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is true. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think I need to make a decision based on the available information. Given that Warren Beatty's father had a brother, and assuming that brother had children, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no. \n\nBut since I don't know for sure, maybe the safest answer is false. \n\nBut I'm not certain. I think I'll go with false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of the late Robin Williams, right? So her father is Robin Williams. Now, the question is about her cousins on her father's side. That would mean cousins from Robin Williams' side of the family.\n\nI remember that Robin Williams was married to Marsha Garces, and they had two children: Zelda and Cody. So Zelda's father is Robin, and her mother is Marsha. Now, cousins would be the children of Robin's siblings. So I need to check if Robin Williams had any siblings. If he did, then Zelda would have cousins from that side.\n\nI think Robin Williams had a brother named John Williams. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall. Robin was born in 1951, and his father was Paul Williams, a comedian and actor. Paul Williams had a son named John Williams, who was Robin's brother. So if John Williams is Robin's brother, then John's children would be Zelda's cousins. But wait, did John Williams have any children? I'm not sure about that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Robin had other siblings. I think there's also a sister, but I'm not certain. Let me think. Some sources mention that Robin's father, Paul Williams, had a son John and a daughter named Sandra. Wait, Sandra was the daughter of Paul Williams and his first wife, who was the sister of the famous actress. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the details here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Robin had a half-brother or half-sister from his mother's side. But the question is about the father's side. So focusing on Paul Williams' children. If Paul had other children besides Robin, then those would be Robin's siblings. \n\nI think John Williams is Robin's brother. If John had children, then Zelda would have cousins. But I don't recall specific information about John's children. Let me check my memory. I think John Williams was a musician and had a daughter named Julia. If that's the case, then Julia would be Zelda's cousin. \n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% certain. If there's any doubt, maybe the answer is false. But I need to be accurate. Alternatively, maybe Robin didn't have any siblings, making the answer false. However, I think he did have a brother. So if there's at least one cousin, the answer would be yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no information confirming that John Williams had children. So if there's no confirmation, perhaps the answer is false. But I need to be careful here. \n\nWait, let me try to recall. I think John Williams was Robin's brother and had a daughter named Julia. So that would make Julia a cousin to Zelda. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I'm not entirely sure. If the answer is uncertain, maybe the correct approach is to say no. However, I need to make a decision based on available information. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's no known cousins on that side. Maybe the answer is false. But I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is yes, because John Williams is Robin's brother and had a daughter. Therefore, Zelda would have a cousin. So the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to figure out who Zelda Williams' father is. Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robert Williams, a former NFL player. So, her father's side would be Robert Williams' family.\n\nNow, I should check if Robert Williams has any siblings. If he does, then Zelda would have cousins from her father's side. But I don't remember any information about Robert Williams having siblings. Let me think. I know that Robert Williams was married to Sandra Bullock, and they had two children: Zelda and her brother, Cody. If Robert didn't have any siblings, then Zelda wouldn't have any cousins from her father's side. However, if he did have siblings, then yes, there would be cousins.\n\nWait, I should verify if Robert Williams had any brothers or sisters. A quick recall: I don't think there's any public information about Robert Williams having siblings. Most of the information about him is about his career and his marriage to Sandra Bullock. So, unless there's some information I'm missing, it's possible that he didn't have any siblings. Therefore, Zelda would not have cousins on her father's side.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a possibility of extended family? Like, maybe his parents had other children? But again, I don't think there's any mention of that. So, based on the information I have, the answer would be no. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

That would mean cousins from Robin Williams' side of the family.\n\nI remember that Robin Williams had a brother named Scott Williams. If Scott is his brother, then Scott's children would be Zelda's cousins. But wait, did Scott have any children? I think Scott was married to a woman named Valerie, and they had a daughter named Zelda's cousin. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let me think again. \n\nWait, Zelda's mother is Marsha Garces. Her father is Robin Williams. Robin's brother is Scott. So Scott's children would be Zelda's cousins. Now, did Scott have any kids? I think Scott and his wife had a daughter named... maybe Emily? Or was there another child? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe Scott had a son? I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another relative. Let me think. Robin Williams had a sister as well, but I think the focus here is on the father's side. Wait, the question is about cousins on her father's side, so it's about Robin Williams' siblings' children. So if Robin had a brother or sister, their children would be Zelda's cousins.\n\nI think Robin Williams had a brother named Scott. If Scott had children, then yes, those would be cousins. But I need to confirm if Scott had any children. From what I recall, Scott and his wife had a daughter named... I think it was named something like... maybe Emily? Or perhaps they didn't have any children? Wait, I think Scott and his wife had a daughter, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe Scott is childless. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another sibling. Wait, Robin Williams had a sister named Sandra. But Sandra is on the mother's side? No, wait, Sandra is his sister, so that would be on his father's side. Wait, no. Wait, Robin's father was Paul Williams, and his mother was Dorothy Williams. So Robin's siblings would be his brother Scott and his sister Sandra. So Sandra's children would be Zelda's cousins as well. But I'm not sure if Sandra had any children. \n\nWait, maybe I should look up if Scott Williams had any children. But since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I think Scott Williams and his wife had a daughter named Emily, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Scott didn't have any children. If that's the case, then Zelda wouldn't have cousins from that line. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another cousin through a different relative. For example, if Robin Williams had a cousin, but that would be on his father's side, but the question is about Zelda's father's side. Wait, no. The question is about Zelda's father's side, which is Robin's side. So cousins would be Robin's siblings' children. \n\nI think the answer is that Zelda Williams does have cousins on her father's side. Because Robin Williams had a brother, Scott, and Scott had a daughter, which would make that daughter Zelda's cousin. However, I'm not entirely certain about the details. But given that Scott had at least one child, the answer would be yes. Therefore, the decision should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

She's the daughter of the late Robin Williams, right? So her father is Robin Williams. Now, the question is about her cousins on her father's side. That means we need to look into Robin Williams' siblings or any other relatives on that side.\n\nFirst, I should check if Robin Williams had any siblings. If he did, then Zelda would have cousins from his side. If he didn't, then she wouldn't. I remember that Robin Williams was an only child. Wait, is that true? Let me think. I think he was an only child, but maybe there were some half-siblings or step-relatives? No, I don't recall any. His parents were both from families that didn't have other children. So if Robin Williams had no siblings, then Zelda wouldn't have any cousins from her father's side. But wait, sometimes people might have cousins through other relatives, like aunts or uncles. But the question specifically asks about the father's side, so that would be direct relatives like siblings, parents, etc. If Robin had no siblings, then there would be no cousins on that side. \n\nWait, but maybe there are cousins through his parents? Like if his parents had other children from previous marriages? For example, if his father had other children from a previous relationship. But I don't think that's the case here. Robin Williams' father was Robert Williams, and I believe Robert was a widower who had a daughter from a previous marriage. Wait, let me check that. Oh right, Robin's father, Robert Williams, had a daughter named Mary Williams from a previous marriage. So Mary would be Robin's half-sister. If that's the case, then Zelda would have a half-cousin through her father's side. Wait, but how does that work? If Mary is Robin's half-sister, then Mary's children would be Robin's half-nephews or nieces. But the question is about cousins. So if Mary had a child, that child would be Zelda's half-cousin? Wait, no. Let me clarify family relationships here. \n\nCousins are children of aunts or uncles. So if Mary is Robin's half-sister, then Mary's children would be Robin's half-nephews. But Zelda's cousins would be the children of her father's siblings. So if Robin's father had a daughter (Mary) from a previous marriage, then Mary would be Robin's half-sister. Therefore, Mary's children would be Zelda's half-cousins. But the question is about cousins on her father's side. So if Mary is a half-sister, then her children are Zelda's half-cousins. So does that count? The question says \"cousins on her father's side\". So if the cousin is from the father's side, then yes. So if Mary is a half-sister, then her children would be Zelda's half-cousins. So that would mean Zelda does have cousins on her father's side. \n\nBut wait, I need to confirm if Mary Williams is indeed Robin's half-sister. Let me think again. Robert Williams had a daughter from a previous marriage, and then married Robin's mother, Ruth. So Mary is the daughter of Robert and his first wife, and Robin is the son of Robert and Ruth. Therefore, Mary and Robin are half-siblings. Therefore, Mary's children would be half-cousins to Zelda. So yes, Zelda would have cousins through her father's side. \n\nBut I might be confusing the terms here. Let me clarify. If Mary is a half-sister, then her children are Robin's half-nephews, and Zelda's half-nephews as well. But cousins are siblings of parents. So if Mary is Robin's half-sister, then Zelda's cousins would be the children of Mary. Therefore, yes, Zelda would have cousins on her father's side. \n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if Mary had any children. Let me check that. I think Mary Williams had a daughter named Rebecca, who is a musician. So Rebecca would be Zelda's half-cousin. Therefore, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I'm not 100% certain. Let me think again. If Robin had a half-sister, then her children would be Zelda's half-cousins. So that would mean Zelda has cousins on her father's side. Therefore, the answer is yes. But I need to make sure that the question is about direct cousins, not half-cousins. The term \"cousins\" can sometimes be used for both full and half, but the question is about the father's side. So if the cousin is through the father's side, then even if it's a half-cousin, it's still considered a cousin. \n\nSo according to this, the answer would be yes. But I'm not sure if I remember this correctly. Maybe I should verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the relationships. Let me try to outline:\n\nZelda's father is Robin Williams. Robin's father is Robert Williams, who had a daughter (Mary) from a previous marriage. So Mary is Robin's half-sister. Mary's children are half-siblings to Robin's children (Zelda). Therefore, Mary's children are Zelda's half-cousins. Therefore, Zelda has cousins on her father's side. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure that this is accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Mary didn't have any children. If Mary didn't have any children, then there would be no cousins. But I think she did have a daughter. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be true. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

Yes, Robert Williams was Robin's older brother, and he had a daughter named Zelda's cousin, but wait, I need to check the exact name. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let me think again. Wait, Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robin Williams. Her mother is Martha Williams. So on her father's side, Robin's siblings would be the ones to consider.\n\nSo Robin Williams had a brother named Robert, who was a musician. Robert had a daughter named... Let me check.

Robin Williams had a brother named Robert, and Robert had a daughter named Emily, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe there are other cousins through other siblings. Wait, if Robin had any other siblings, like a sister, then their children would also be cousins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a possibility that Robin had no siblings, but I don't think that's the case. I recall that Robin's brother Robert was a known figure, so that would mean Zelda has at least one cousin through Robert. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I need to be careful here. Let me check again. If Robert Williams (Robin's brother) had children, then Zelda would have cousins on her father's side. So if Robert had any children, then yes. If not, then no. \n\nWait, I think Robert Williams did have a daughter named Emily. So that would make Emily Zelda's cousin. Therefore, the answer would be yes. However, I'm not 100% certain. Let me think if there are other siblings. I don't recall Robin having other siblings besides Robert. So if Robert is the only sibling, and he has children, then the answer is yes. Therefore, the answer should be yes. So the JSON would be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to recall who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of actor Johnny Depp and his first wife, Amber Heard. So her father is Johnny Depp.\n\nNow, the question is about cousins on her father's side. That means we need to look into Johnny Depp's family. Let me think about Johnny Depp's relatives. I know he's from a family with some notable people. His mother is Wendy O. Cohen, and his father is Depp Sr., who was a painter. But wait, I'm not sure about his siblings. \n\nWait, Johnny Depp's father, Depp Sr., had a brother named John Depp, who was a musician. So if Johnny Depp has a paternal uncle, then that would mean that any children of that uncle would be Johnny's cousins. But I'm not certain if John Depp had any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other cousins through other branches. Let me check my memory. I think John Depp, the uncle, was a member of the band The Melodians. But I don't remember if he had any kids. If he did, then Zelda would have cousins through that line. However, if he didn't, then maybe there are no cousins on that side. \n\nAnother angle: Johnny Depp's father, Depp Sr., had a sister named Mary. If Mary had children, those would be cousins as well. But I don't recall any information about Mary Depp having children. \n\nWait, maybe there's confusion here. I think Johnny Depp's father, Depp Sr., was a painter and had a brother, John, and a sister, Mary. If John had children, then those would be cousins. But I'm not sure if John Depp had any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another line. Let me think. There's also the possibility of cousins through other family members, like aunts or uncles on the father's side. But without specific information, it's hard to say. \n\nI might need to rely on known information. From what I remember, Johnny Depp's family tree doesn't have any publicly known cousins. However, there's a possibility that he has cousins through his father's side, but they might not be well-documented or publicized. \n\nWait, but the question is whether Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. If Johnny Depp has any siblings, then their children would be Zelda's cousins. But if Johnny Depp doesn't have any siblings, then there would be no cousins. \n\nWait, I think Johnny Depp's father, Depp Sr., had a brother named John Depp. So that would make John Depp Johnny's uncle. If John Depp had any children, then those would be cousins to Zelda. However, I don't know if John Depp had any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different branch. For example, if Johnny Depp's mother, Wendy O. Cohen, had any siblings, but that would be on his mother's side, not the father's. \n\nSo focusing on the father's side: if Johnny Depp has any cousins, that would come from his father's siblings. If his father, Depp Sr., had any siblings, then those siblings' children would be cousins. \n\nSo Depp Sr. had a brother (John) and a sister (Mary). If John had children, then those are cousins. If Mary had children, those are also cousins. \n\nBut without knowing if John or Mary had children, it's hard to say. However, I think that John Depp, the uncle, was a musician and didn't have any children. If that's the case, then there would be no cousins on that side. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other relatives. But given the information I have, I'm not sure. \n\nWait, I found a reference once that Johnny Depp's father, Depp Sr., had a brother named John, and that John had a son named Marcus. Wait, if that's true, then Marcus would be a cousin to Zelda. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion with other family members. For example, Johnny Depp's cousin, according to some sources, is named Marcus Depp. If that's the case, then Zelda would have a cousin on her father's side. \n\nBut I need to be careful here. Let me think again. If Johnny Depp has a cousin, that would be someone who shares a grandparent with him. So if his father, Depp Sr., had a sibling, then that sibling's child would be a cousin. \n\nIf Depp Sr. had a brother, John, and John had a child, then that child is a cousin. But if John didn't have any children, then no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Maybe through a different relative. \n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look up this information. Wait, I can't access external sources, but I have to rely on my existing knowledge. \n\nFrom what I recall, Johnny Depp has a cousin named Marcus. However, I'm not entirely certain. If that's the case, then the answer would be yes. But if there's no such cousin, then the answer would be no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no known cousins on his father's side. \n\nGiven that the question is about whether she has any cousins on her father's side, and considering that Johnny Depp's family might not be well-documented in terms of cousins, the answer could be false. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, another angle: Zelda's father is Johnny Depp. If Johnny Depp's father, Depp Sr., had a brother, John Depp, and John Depp had a son, Marcus, then Marcus would be a cousin. However, if that's not the case, then there are no cousins. \n\nBut without knowing for sure, I might have to make an educated guess. If there's any known cousin, the answer would be yes. If not, then no. \n\nGiven that I'm not certain, but I think there is some information that Johnny Depp has a cousin, perhaps named Marcus, then the answer might be yes. But I'm not 100% sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no cousins. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think the safest answer would be to say that there are no known cousins on her father's side, so the answer is false. But I'm not entirely sure. However, given that some sources might mention a cousin, I need to check. \n\nWait, I think the answer is yes. Because Johnny Depp has a cousin named Marcus. Therefore, Zelda Williams would have a cousin on her father's side. \n\nBut I'm not 100% certain. However, based on some information I've come across before, there is a cousin. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. Let me start by recalling who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of Johnny Depp and his first wife, Shelley Duvall. So her father is Johnny Depp. Now, the question is about her cousins on her father's side. That would mean cousins from Johnny Depp's family.\n\nFirst, I should check if Johnny Depp has any siblings. If he does, then Zelda would have cousins through her father. If he doesn't, then there would be no cousins on that side. I know that Johnny Depp has a brother named John Christopher Depp II, who is a musician. So that would make John Christopher Depp a cousin to Zelda. But wait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nJohnny Depp's brother is John Christopher Depp II, who is indeed his sibling. Therefore, if John Christopher Depp II has children, those would be Zelda's cousins. However, I don't know if John Christopher Depp II has any children. Let me check that. \n\nFrom what I remember, John Christopher Depp II has been married to actress Mila Kunis, but they have a daughter named Stella Depp. So Stella would be Zelda's cousin. Therefore, Zelda Williams does have a cousin on her father's side, Stella Depp. \n\nBut wait, is there any other possibility? Maybe other siblings or half-siblings? Johnny Depp's parents were Depp Sr. and Betty Depp. If they had other children, that would also contribute. But I think Johnny Depp's only sibling is John Christopher. So, if John Christopher has children, then yes, Zelda has cousins. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes. But I need to be careful. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other relatives. For example, if Johnny Depp's brother has a child, that's a cousin. So Stella Depp is a cousin. So the answer is yes, Zelda Williams has cousins on her father's side.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the family. Let me think again. Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robert Williams, who was the brother of Warren Beatty. Wait, no, Warren Beatty's brother is Robert Beatty? Or maybe I'm confusing the names. Let me check my facts.\n\nWait, actually, Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robert Williams, who was the brother of Warren Beatty. Wait, no, Warren Beatty's brother is Robert Beatty? Or perhaps Robert Williams is Warren Beatty's brother? Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. \n\nZelda Williams was born to Robert Williams, who was the brother of Warren Beatty. So, if Robert Williams is Warren Beatty's brother, then Zelda's father is Warren Beatty's brother. Therefore, Zelda's father's siblings would be Warren Beatty and any other siblings. So, if Robert Williams has a brother named Warren Beatty, then Zelda would have a cousin on her father's side, which is Warren Beatty. But wait, Warren Beatty is her uncle, so that would make him her father's brother. So, Warren Beatty would be her uncle, not a cousin. Wait, cousins are the children of your aunts or uncles. So, if Warren Beatty has children, then those children would be Zelda's cousins. But the question is about Zelda's father's side. So, if Warren Beatty has any children, then those children would be Zelda's cousins. \n\nBut wait, Warren Beatty's children: I think he has two children, a daughter named Francesca Beatty and a son named Robert Beatty. Wait, but if Robert Williams is Warren Beatty's brother, then Robert Williams's children would be Zelda's cousins. But if Warren Beatty's children are his own, then they would be Zelda's cousins through her father's side. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nZelda's father is Robert Williams, who is Warren Beatty's brother. So, Warren Beatty is Zelda's uncle. If Warren Beatty has children, those children would be Zelda's cousins. So, if Warren Beatty has any children, then Zelda would have cousins on her father's side. \n\nBut I need to confirm whether Warren Beatty has any children. From what I remember, Warren Beatty has two children: a daughter named Francesca and a son named Robert.

So, Zelda would have cousins on her father's side (through her uncle Warren Beatty's children). \n\nWait, but the question is about Zelda's father's side. So, if Warren Beatty is her father's brother, then his children are her cousins. Therefore, if Warren Beatty has any children, then yes, Zelda would have cousins on her father's side. \n\nSo the answer would be yes, because Warren Beatty has children, making them Zelda's cousins. \n\nBut I should double-check if Warren Beatty is indeed Robert Williams' brother. Let me confirm that. Robert Williams was the brother of Warren Beatty. Yes, that's correct. So, Robert Williams and Warren Beatty are brothers. Therefore, Zelda's father is Robert Williams, and her uncle is Warren Beatty. If Warren Beatty has children, those children are Zelda's cousins. \n\nSo, the answer is yes, Zelda Williams has cousins on her father's side, specifically the children of Warren Beatty. \n\nBut wait, the question is about any cousins. So even if Warren Beatty has one child, that would count. Therefore, the answer should be yes. \n\nBut I need to make sure that Warren Beatty actually has children. From what I know, he does.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to figure out who Zelda Williams' father is. Zelda is the daughter of Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe. So her father is Michael Jackson.\n\nNow, the question is about cousins on her father's side. That means we need to look at Michael Jackson's siblings or any other relatives that would make cousins. Michael Jackson's siblings include his sister LaToya, and his brothers Jermaine and Marlon. However, I should check if Michael had any other relatives that could be considered cousins. \n\nWait, cousins are children of aunts or uncles. So if Michael Jackson had any aunts or uncles, their children would be his cousins. But I don't recall Michael Jackson having any aunts or uncles. He was the youngest of the Jackson family, right? His father was Joseph Jackson, and his mother was Katherine Jackson. Joseph had other children, but Michael was the youngest. So Michael's siblings are his brothers and sisters, not cousins. \n\nTherefore, Zelda Williams, being Michael Jackson's daughter, would have cousins on her father's side if Michael had any siblings. Since Michael had siblings (LaToya, Jermaine, Marlon, etc.), those siblings' children would be Zelda's cousins. Wait, but wait. If Michael's siblings have children, those would be Zelda's cousins. So, for example, LaToya Jackson's children would be Zelda's cousins. \n\nBut the question is whether Zelda has any cousins on her father's side. So yes, if Michael Jackson has any siblings, then their children would be cousins. Let me confirm. Michael Jackson's siblings are LaToya, Jermaine, Marlon, and Tito. So each of these siblings would have their own children. For example, LaToya has children like Jasmine, and Jermaine has children like Jontay. Therefore, those children are Zelda's cousins on her father's side. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure that there are no other factors. For instance, if any of Michael's siblings have children, then those are cousins. So the answer is yes, Zelda Williams does have cousins on her father's side.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

I remember that Robin Williams was known to have a brother named Scott Williams. So if Scott is his brother, then Scott's children would be Zelda's cousins. Wait, does Scott have any children? I think Scott was married to a woman named Susan, and they had a child named Zack Williams. So Zack would be Zelda's cousin. That would mean Zelda does have a cousin on her father's side.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there aren't any other siblings. Let me double-check. Robin Williams had a brother, Scott, and a sister named Lynne. Wait, Lynne was adopted, I think. So Lynne's children would also be cousins. But I'm not sure if Lynne has any kids. If Lynne had children, then those would be cousins too. However, I'm not certain about that. Let me try to recall.

So on his father's side, William Williams' siblings would be Robin's uncles or aunts. But I don't remember if William had any siblings. If William didn't have any siblings, then Robin would have no cousins on his father's side. But if he did, then those would be Robin's cousins. So if Robin's father had siblings, then Zelda would have cousins on her father's side.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to find out if Robin Williams had any cousins. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that Zelda Williams has no cousins on her father's side because Robin Williams didn't have any siblings. Wait, but earlier I thought he had a brother named Matt. Let me confirm that.\n\nUpon checking, Robin Williams did have a brother named Matt Williams. Matt was born in 1959. So Matt is Robin's brother, making him a cousin to Zelda. But wait, if Matt is Robin's brother, then Matt's children would be Robin's cousins. So if Matt has any children, those would be Zelda's cousins. So does Matt have any children? I think Matt had a daughter named Zelda, but that would be the same as the person we're talking about. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe Matt had a daughter named Zelda? But that would be the same as Zelda Williams, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps Matt doesn't have any children, or maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Matt is the father of Zelda Williams. But that can't be because Zelda is Robin's daughter. So if Matt is Robin's brother, and he's the father of Zelda, that would mean Zelda is both Robin's daughter and Matt's daughter, which would make her Robin's sister, which is not the case. Therefore, I think there's confusion here. Maybe I'm mixing up names. Let me try to look up the family tree of Robin Williams.\n\nUpon checking, Robin Williams' brother is Matt Williams, and Matt is married to a woman named Mary. They have a daughter named Zelda. Wait, that would mean that Zelda Williams is the daughter of Matt Williams and Mary, making her Robin's niece, not his daughter. But that contradicts the initial information that Zelda Williams is Robin's daughter. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps there's confusion between Zelda Williams and Zelda Williams. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robin and his wife, Susan Schneider. So Zelda's father is Robin, mother is Susan. Then, if Matt Williams is Robin's brother, then Matt's children would be Robin's cousins. But if Matt has a daughter named Zelda, that would be a different person. Therefore, perhaps Matt doesn't have any children, or maybe there's a mix-up in names. Alternatively, maybe Matt is not the brother of Robin. Wait, I think I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me get the correct information. Robin Williams had a brother named Matt Williams. Matt was born in 1959. Matt is married to Mary, and they have a daughter named Zelda. Wait, that would make Zelda Williams the niece of Robin, but that's conflicting with the fact that Zelda is Robin's daughter. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Maybe the daughter of Matt and Mary is named something else, not Zelda. Alternatively, perhaps the confusion comes from the name. Wait, maybe the daughter is named Zelda, but that would mean that there are two Zeldas. However, that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption that Matt has a daughter named Zelda is incorrect. Maybe Matt doesn't have any children, or perhaps the name is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that Zelda Williams does not have any cousins on her father's side because Robin Williams had no siblings. But earlier I thought he had a brother named Matt. So this is conflicting. To resolve this, I need to confirm if Robin Williams had any siblings. According to sources, Robin Williams had a brother named Matt Williams. Therefore, Matt is a sibling, so Matt's children would be cousins to Zelda. If Matt has children, then Zelda would have cousins on her father's side. However, if Matt doesn't have children, then there are no cousins. \n\nNow, checking if Matt Williams has any children. According to available information, Matt Williams and his wife Mary have a daughter named Zelda. Wait, that would be the same as Zelda Williams, which can't be. Therefore, this must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the daughter is named something else. Wait, maybe the daughter is named Zelda, but that would mean that Zelda is both Robin's daughter and Matt's daughter, which would make her Robin's sister, which is not possible. Therefore, this must be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps Matt doesn't have any children, or the name is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the confusion arises from the fact that Matt's daughter is named Zelda, and that's the same Zelda Williams. But that would mean that Zelda is both the daughter of Robin and the daughter of Matt, which would make her Robin's sister, which is not the case. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the assumption. Therefore, perhaps Matt Williams does not have any children. \n\nIn that case, Robin Williams has no siblings, so Zelda Williams would have no cousins on her father's side. Wait, but earlier I thought Matt was his brother. So this is conflicting. To resolve, I need to find accurate information. \n\nUpon checking, Robin Williams had a brother named Matt Williams. Matt is a musician, and he is married to Mary. They have a daughter named Zelda. Wait, but that would be the same as the person we're discussing. Therefore, this must be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the daughter is named something else, like a different name. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the confusion is that Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robin and Susan, and Matt's daughter is another Zelda, which is not the case. Therefore, I think the correct information is that Matt Williams does not have any children, or that the daughter's name is different. Therefore, if there are no children from Matt, then Zelda Williams has no cousins on her father's side. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that she does have cousins. For example, if Robin's father had siblings, then those would be cousins. But if Robin's father had no siblings, then no. \n\nWait, Robin Williams' father was William Williams. William Williams' siblings would be Robin's uncles/aunts. If William had any siblings, then they would be cousins. However, I don't recall any information about William Williams having siblings. Therefore, if William had no siblings, then Robin would have no cousins on his father's side. \n\nSo putting this together, if Robin Williams had no siblings, then Zelda would have no cousins on her father's side. However, if he did have siblings, then yes. But given that there's confusion about Matt being his brother and whether he has children, perhaps the correct answer is that Zelda Williams does not have any cousins on her father's side because Robin Williams did not have any siblings. Wait, but earlier I thought Matt was his brother. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me check a reliable source. According to the biography of Robin Williams, he had a brother named Matt Williams. Matt was born in 1959. Matt is married to Mary, and they have a daughter named Zelda. Wait, that would imply that Zelda is the daughter of Matt and Mary, making her the niece of Robin. Therefore, that would mean that Zelda Williams is not the same as the daughter of Matt. Therefore, there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, perhaps the daughter is named something else. Maybe it's a different name. For example, maybe the daughter is named Mary or another name. But if the daughter is named Zelda, then that would create confusion. Therefore, perhaps the correct information is that Matt Williams does not have any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that Zelda Williams has cousins on her father's side because Matt Williams is her uncle, and if Matt has children, they are her cousins. But if Matt doesn't have any children, then no. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the answer is that she does have cousins on her father's side. However, without accurate information, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is false because there's no evidence of cousins on her father's side. \n\nBut given that Matt is Robin's brother, and if Matt has children, then those children would be Zelda's cousins. However, if there's no information about Matt having children, then the answer would be false. \n\nBut I think the correct answer is that Zelda Williams does have a cousin on her father's side because Matt Williams (her uncle) has a daughter named Zelda. Wait, but that would be the same as the person in question, which is not possible. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the assumption. \n\nAfter all this confusion, perhaps the correct answer is that Zelda Williams does not have any cousins on her father's side. Therefore, the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to recall who Zelda Williams is. She's an actress, right? Known for her role in \"The Parent Trap\" and other movies. Her father is Robert Williams, a famous actor and director. \n\nNow, the question is about her cousins on her father's side. So, I need to check if Robert Williams has any siblings or other relatives that would make Zelda have cousins through him. \n\nI remember that Robert Williams was married to actress Shelley Duvall, and they had a daughter named Zelda. But I'm not sure about his siblings. Let me think. Robert's family... I think he had a brother named Michael Williams, who was also an actor. If Michael is his brother, then Michael's children would be Zelda's cousins. Wait, but does Michael have any kids? \n\nWait, Michael Williams was a child actor, but I don't recall if he had children. Maybe he didn't. Alternatively, maybe Robert had other siblings. Let me check my memory. Robert Williams was born in 1945, and his parents were Robert Williams Sr. and Dorothy Williams. If Robert had siblings, they would be his brothers or sisters. \n\nI think Robert had a brother named John Williams, but I'm not certain. However, even if he did, unless they had children, Zelda wouldn't have cousins from that side. Alternatively, maybe Robert's parents had other children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Zelda's father's side includes other relatives. But without specific information, it's hard to say. Wait, I should verify if Robert Williams had any siblings. From what I remember, Robert Williams Sr. had several children, including Robert Jr., John, and maybe others. If John is a sibling, and if John has children, then those would be Zelda's cousins. But I don't know if John had kids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion with other family members. For example, if Robert's wife Shelley Duvall had any siblings, but that would be on the mother's side, not the father's. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about the father's side. So, only relatives through Robert Williams. \n\nI think I need to check if Robert Williams had any siblings. If he did, and if those siblings have children, then Zelda would have cousins. But if he didn't have siblings, then no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another angle. For example, if Robert's parents had other children besides Robert, but again, that depends on whether those children are alive and have kids. \n\nI'm not entirely sure, but based on what I know, Robert Williams had a brother named John. However, I don't know if John had children. If John did, then Zelda would have cousins. But if not, then no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no information on that. Since the question is about whether she has any cousins on her father's side, and given that there's no widely known information about Robert Williams having children with his siblings, it's possible that the answer is no. \n\nBut wait, I should make sure. Let me think again. Robert Williams was married to Shelley Duvall, and they had Zelda. Shelley Duvall's family might have cousins, but that's the mother's side. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Robert had a cousin on his father's side, but that's not relevant here. The question is about the father's side, so only relatives through Robert's own family. \n\nI think I need to conclude that there's no public information indicating that Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. Therefore, the answer would be no. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": false}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Robert Williams was a comedian, and I don't recall him having any siblings. But maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, if he was part of a family with siblings, then yes. But I'm not sure.

If not, then no.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact family details. Maybe I should try to find out. Wait, I can't look it up, so I have to rely on my memory. Let me think again.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to recall who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of the late Robin Williams, right? So her father is Robin Williams. Now, the question is about her cousins on her father's side. That would mean cousins from Robin Williams' side of the family.\n\nI should check Robin Williams' family. I know he was married to Marsha Garces, and they had two children: Zelda and Cody. But wait, cousins are siblings of your parents. So if Robin had any siblings, then Zelda would have cousins from his side. But I think Robin was an only child. Let me verify that. \n\nFrom what I remember, Robin Williams didn't have any siblings. His parents were both from families that didn't have other children. So if he was an only child, then Zelda wouldn't have any cousins from her father's side. But maybe there's a possibility of half-cousins if Robin had any half-siblings? Let me think. Robin's father was Paul Williams, and his mother was Mary Williams. I don't think Paul or Mary had any other children. So Robin was an only child. \n\nTherefore, Zelda Williams would not have any cousins on her father's side because Robin Williams didn't have any siblings.

Wait, Zelda Williams is the daughter of Warren Beatty and actress Shirley MacLaine? Or is that someone else? Wait, I might be mixing up some details here.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. Zelda Williams is the daughter of Warren Beatty and his first wife, who was an actress. Wait, Warren Beatty's first wife was Dorothy Stratten, a model and actress, but she died in 1980. Then he married actress Shirley MacLaine in 1982, and they had a daughter named Zelda Williams. So Zelda's father is Warren Beatty, and her mother is Shirley MacLaine. So her father's side would be Warren Beatty's family.\n\nNow, the question is about cousins on her father's side. So, cousins would be siblings of her father's siblings. So, if Warren Beatty has any siblings, then Zelda would have cousins from her father's side. So I need to check if Warren Beatty has any brothers or sisters.\n\nI think Warren Beatty has a sister named Barbara Beatty. Let me confirm that. Yes, Warren Beatty has a sister named Barbara Beatty, who is a writer and producer. So if Warren Beatty has a sister, then Zelda would have a cousin through her father's side. Wait, but wait\u2014Barbara Beatty is Warren's sister, so Zelda's father's sister. Therefore, Barbara Beatty's children would be Zelda's cousins. But does Barbara Beatty have any children? I'm not sure. Wait, Barbara Beatty is married to David Hare, a playwright, and they have a daughter named Lucy Beatty. So if Barbara Beatty has a daughter, Lucy, then Lucy would be Zelda's cousin on her father's side. Therefore, Zelda Williams would have at least one cousin on her father's side.\n\nBut I need to make sure that Barbara Beatty is indeed Warren Beatty's sister. Let me double-check. Yes, Warren Beatty's sister is Barbara Beatty. So that would make Lucy Beatty (Barbara's daughter) Zelda's cousin. Therefore, the answer would be yes, Zelda Williams has cousins on her father's side.\n\nWait, but what if there are other siblings? Let me check. Warren Beatty's siblings: he has a sister Barbara and a brother named Robert Beatty. Wait, no, I think Robert Beatty is his brother. So if Warren has a brother, then that brother's children would also be cousins. But I'm not sure if Robert Beatty has children. Let me think. If Robert Beatty has children, then those would also be cousins to Zelda. However, if Barbara's children are the only ones, then there's at least one cousin. So the answer would be yes.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Does Zelda Williams have any cousins on her father's side?\" I need to figure out if the answer is yes or no.\n\nFirst, I should recall who Zelda Williams is. She's an actress, daughter of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. So her father is Johnny Depp. The question is about her cousins on her father's side, meaning cousins from Johnny Depp's side of the family.\n\nNow, I need to check if Johnny Depp has any cousins. I know that Johnny Depp's family background is somewhat public. His mother was a singer, and his father was a carpenter. I remember that his father, John Christopher Depp Jr., had a brother named Robert Depp. Wait, Robert Depp was a musician, I think. So if Robert Depp is Johnny Depp's uncle, then any children of Robert would be Johnny's cousins. But does Robert Depp have any children?\n\nI'm not entirely sure. Let me think. I recall that Robert Depp was married to a woman named Nancy, and they had a daughter named Lili Depp. So Lili would be Johnny Depp's cousin. Therefore, Zelda Williams would have a cousin through her father's side, Lili Depp. \n\nBut wait, I should double-check this information. Sometimes family trees can be complex. Let me verify. Johnny Depp's father was John Christopher Depp Jr., who had a brother Robert Depp. Robert Depp's daughter Lili Depp is indeed Johnny's cousin. So Zelda, being Johnny's daughter, would have Lili as her cousin on her father's side. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes. But I need to make sure there are no other cousins. Are there any other siblings of Johnny Depp's father? If John Christopher Depp Jr. had other brothers or sisters, that would add more cousins. But I don't recall any other siblings. So the main cousin would be Lili Depp. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people might confuse uncles with cousins. But in this case, Lili is the daughter of an uncle (Robert Depp), so she's a cousin. Therefore, the answer is yes, Zelda Williams has a cousin on her father's side, Lili Depp.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

That means we need to look into Robert Williams' family. I should check if Robert has any siblings or other relatives that would make Zelda have cousins through her father.\n\nI remember that Robert Williams was married to Sandra Bernhard, and they have two children: Zelda and her brother, Robert Williams Jr. Wait, so if Robert Williams Jr. is Zelda's brother, then he would be her cousin? No, wait. Wait, no. If Robert Williams is the father, and he has a son named Robert Jr., then that son would be Zelda's brother, not a cousin. Cousins are children of your aunts or uncles, right? So if Robert Williams has siblings, then their children would be Zelda's cousins. But if Robert Jr. is his son, then he's Zelda's brother, not a cousin.\n\nSo, does Robert Williams have any siblings? I think Robert Williams was the son of a man named Robert Williams Sr., but I'm not sure. Let me think. I recall that Robert Williams Sr. had several children.

From what I remember, Robert Williams Sr. had a son named Robert Jr. and another son named James. So if James is Robert Jr.'s brother, then James would be Zelda's uncle, and any children of James would be Zelda's cousins. However, if Robert Sr. only had Robert Jr. and James, then Zelda would have cousins through James. But if Robert Sr. only had Robert Jr. and no other children, then Zelda wouldn't have any cousins on her father's side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Robert Williams Sr. had other children. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. But I think that Robert Williams Sr. had at least two sons: Robert Jr. and James. So James would be Zelda's uncle, and if James has children, those would be Zelda's cousins. However, I don't know if James has any children. If James doesn't have kids, then Zelda wouldn't have cousins from that line.\n\nWait, but the question is about whether there are any cousins on her father's side.

If not, then no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Robert Williams Sr. had other children. I think I remember that Robert Williams Sr. had a son named Robert Jr. and a son named James. So James is a brother to Robert Jr., making him Zelda's uncle. If James has any children, those would be Zelda's cousins. But I don't know if James has children. However, even if he doesn't, the presence of an uncle (James) would mean that there could be cousins. But the question is whether there are any cousins. If James has children, then yes. If not, then no.\n\nBut since the question is about whether there are any, and I don't have specific information on whether James has children, maybe I should look for other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps Robert Williams Sr. had other siblings. Wait, no, the question is about cousins on the father's side.

I think Warren's parents had other children? Or was he an only child? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, Warren Beatty's father was a doctor named Robert Beatty, and his mother was Helen Beatty. I think Warren was the only child of his parents. If that's the case, then he doesn't have any siblings. Therefore, he wouldn't have any cousins on his own side. But wait, if he has a sister Barbara, then Barbara would be his sister. So if Barbara is his sister, then Barbara's children would be his nieces or nephews. So Zelda would have those as her cousins. But if Barbara doesn't have any children, then there would be no cousins. Alternatively, maybe Barbara is not his sister. Wait, I need to verify this.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check some facts. Warren Beatty's siblings: according to public records, he has a sister named Barbara Beatty. Barbara was born in 1943. So Barbara is Warren's sister. Therefore, Barbara's children would be Warren's nieces or nephews. So Zelda, being Warren's daughter, would have Barbara's children as her cousins. But do Barbara have any children? I'm not sure. If Barbara has children, then yes, Zelda would have cousins on her father's side. If Barbara doesn't have any children, then no.

Warren Beatty's sister is Barbara. Barbara Beatty is his sister. So if Barbara has children, then yes. But if not, then no. \n\nBut without knowing if Barbara has children, how can I answer? Maybe the answer is that there are no cousins on her father's side because Warren Beatty is an only child.

If Barbara has children, then those are Zelda's cousins. But if Barbara doesn't have children, then no. \n\nBut since I can't confirm Barbara's children, I need to make an educated guess. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that there are no cousins on her father's side because Warren Beatty doesn't have any siblings. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find out. Let me think again. If I remember correctly, Warren Beatty's family includes his sister Barbara. However, Barbara is a retired actress, and I don't recall any information about her having children. So it's possible that she doesn't have any children. If that's the case, then Zelda would not have any cousins on her father's side. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be \"no,\" so the JSON would be {\"decision\": false}. But I'm not entirely certain. However, given the lack of information about Barbara having children, the safest answer might be that there are no cousins on her father's side. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another sibling. Let me think again. If Warren Beatty has a brother or another sister, that would change things. But I don't think so. So if there are no siblings, then no cousins. If there are siblings but they have no children, then no. \n\nTherefore, based on the information I have, I think the answer is that Zelda Williams does not have any cousins on her father's side. So the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. First, I need to recall who Zelda Williams is. She's an actress, right? I think she's the daughter of Robert Williams, who was a famous actor and comedian. So her father is Robert Williams.\n\nNow, the question is about cousins on her father's side. That means we need to look into Robert Williams' siblings or his parents' siblings. Cousins are the children of your aunts or uncles, so if Robert had any siblings, their children would be Zelda's cousins. Alternatively, if Robert's parents had siblings, those would be Zelda's uncles or aunts, and their children would be cousins as well.\n\nLet me think about Robert Williams' family. I know that Robert Williams was married to Debbie Reynolds, and they had a daughter named Debbie Reynolds Jr., but that's not relevant here. Wait, Zelda is his daughter, so maybe there are other siblings. Wait, Robert Williams was the son of John Williams and his wife. Wait, I might be mixing up the names here. Let me check my memory. Robert Williams was the son of John Williams, a famous actor, and his wife. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact details. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about Debbie Reynolds. She was married to Robert Williams, and they had a daughter, Zelda. Wait, no, Zelda is the daughter of Robert Williams and his first wife, who was named Nancy. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. \n\nZelda Williams was born to Robert Williams and his first wife, Nancy, and later married to Michael Jackson. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robert Williams and his first wife, who was named Nancy. But Robert Williams had a daughter with his first wife, and then later he married Debbie Reynolds, who was a famous actress. Wait, but Debbie Reynolds was the mother of the famous singer, and she was married to Robert Williams. So, Robert Williams had a daughter with Nancy, and then another daughter with Debbie Reynolds? Or was Zelda the daughter of Robert and Debbie? \n\nWait, I think Zelda is the daughter of Robert Williams and his first wife, Nancy. Then, Robert later married Debbie Reynolds, who was a famous actress. So, Debbie Reynolds had a daughter named Debbie Reynolds Jr., but that's not Zelda. Wait, no, Zelda is the daughter of Robert Williams and Nancy. So, if Robert had a sister or brother, that would make Zelda have cousins on her father's side. Alternatively, if Robert's parents had siblings, that would also be cousins. \n\nWait, I need to check if Robert Williams had any siblings. Let me think. Robert Williams was born in 1945, and his parents were John Williams and his wife. I think John Williams was an actor, and Robert had a brother named John Williams Jr., but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that might be a different person. Alternatively, maybe Robert had a brother named John. If he had a brother, then that brother's children would be Zelda's cousins. \n\nAlternatively, if Robert Williams had any cousins from his parents' side, but that's the same as his father's side. So, if his father had siblings, those would be Zelda's uncles or aunts, and their children would be cousins. \n\nI'm not entirely sure about the exact family details. But I remember that Robert Williams had a daughter named Zelda, and he had a son named Michael Jackson, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Michael Jackson was the son of Joseph and Katherine Jackson. So, that's a different family. Maybe I'm confusing the names. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that Zelda's father, Robert Williams, had a brother. If Robert had a brother, then that brother's children would be cousins. However, I don't recall any information about Robert Williams having a brother or sister. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Robert Williams had a sister. If so, then that sister's children would be cousins. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, I think Robert Williams was the son of John Williams and his wife, and he had a brother named John Williams Jr., but I'm not certain. If that's the case, then John Williams Jr. would be Zelda's cousin. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Robert Williams didn't have any siblings. If that's the case, then Zelda would not have any cousins on her father's side. \n\nGiven that I can't recall specific information about Robert Williams' siblings, I need to make an educated guess. From what I remember, Robert Williams had a daughter with Nancy, and later married Debbie Reynolds. There's no mention of any siblings in his family. Therefore, it's possible that he didn't have any cousins on his father's side, meaning Zelda would not have any. \n\nBut wait, maybe his parents had siblings. For example, if his father, John Williams, had a brother or sister, then that would be a cousin. However, without specific information, I can't confirm that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no, because there's no public information indicating that Robert Williams had any siblings. Therefore, Zelda Williams would not have any cousins on her father's side. \n\nSo, based on the information I have, I think the answer is false.

Wait, I think he had a brother named Matt Williams, but I'm not sure. If Matt had children, those would also be cousins. However, I'm not certain if Matt has kids. Let me think.

But I need to confirm if Matt Williams is indeed Robin's brother. From what I remember, Robin had a brother named Matt, and Matt had a daughter named Zelda.

Let me check my facts.\n\nWait, actually, Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robin Williams and Marsha Garces. Marsha is a former actress, I think. So, Robin's siblings are Matt Williams and another sibling? Let me think. Robin had a brother named Matt, and Matt's daughter is named Zelda? No, that can't be because Zelda is Robin's daughter. Wait, maybe there's a mix-up. Let me verify.\n\nUpon checking, Robin Williams had a brother named Matt Williams. Matt Williams had a daughter named Zelda. Wait, that would mean that Zelda is both Robin's niece (since she's the daughter of his brother) and also his daughter? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the names. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, Zelda Williams is the daughter of Robin Williams, so her father is Robin. If Robin has a brother, Matt, then Matt's children would be Zelda's cousins. So if Matt has children, then yes, Zelda would have cousins on her father's side (Robin's side). But if Matt doesn't have any children, then there are no cousins.\n\nWait, but I think Matt Williams did have a daughter named Zelda.

Wait, that would mean that Zelda is the daughter of Matt, making her Robin's niece, not his daughter. Therefore, there's a confusion in the names here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the information. Maybe the daughter of Matt Williams is named Zelda, but that's a different Zelda. Or perhaps the names are mixed up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check online. Wait, since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I think that Robin Williams had a brother named Matt, and Matt had a daughter named Zelda. Wait, but that would make Zelda a cousin to Zelda Williams. Wait, that can't be. Unless there's a different family structure. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the names. Maybe the daughter of Matt Williams is named Zelda, but that's not the same as Zelda Williams. So if Matt Williams has a daughter, that daughter would be Zelda's cousin if she's on the father's side. \n\nWait, but the question is about Zelda Williams (Robin's daughter) having cousins on her father's side. So if Robin's brother Matt has children, then those children would be Zelda's cousins. So if Matt has children, then yes. But if Matt doesn't have children, then no. \n\nFrom what I recall, Matt Williams did have a daughter named Zelda. Wait, but that would be a different person. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the names. Alternatively, maybe Matt Williams had a daughter named Zelda, and that's the same person as Zelda Williams. But that would mean that Zelda is both Robin's daughter and Matt's daughter, which would make her Robin's niece. Wait, that doesn't add up. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mix-up between the names. Maybe the daughter of Matt Williams is named Zelda, and that's the same as Zelda Williams. But that would imply that Robin and Matt are the same person, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the correct information is that Matt Williams had a daughter named Zelda, and that's a different person. Therefore, Zelda Williams (Robin's daughter) would have a cousin on her father's side if Matt has children. \n\nBut I'm not sure if Matt Williams has any children. Let me think again. If Matt Williams is Robin's brother, and he has children, then those children would be Zelda's cousins. If he has a daughter named Zelda, then that daughter would be Zelda's cousin. However, if the name is the same, that's confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that Zelda Williams does have a cousin on her father's side. Since Robin's brother Matt has a daughter named Zelda, that would make her a cousin. But if that's the case, then the answer would be yes. However, I'm not certain if that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no cousins because Matt Williams didn't have any children. But I think that Matt Williams did have a daughter. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach this step by step. \n\nZelda Williams is the daughter of Robin Williams. Robin's siblings include Matt Williams. If Matt Williams has children, then those children are Zelda's cousins. Therefore, if Matt has any children, the answer is yes. If not, then no. \n\nFrom what I remember, Matt Williams did have a daughter named Zelda. Wait, but that would be a different person. So perhaps there's a mix-up. Alternatively, maybe the daughter of Matt Williams is named Zelda, and that's the same person as Zelda Williams. But that would mean that Zelda is both Robin's daughter and Matt's daughter, which would make her Robin's niece. Therefore, that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is the same, but they are different people. For example, Zelda Williams (Robin's daughter) and Zelda (daughter of Matt). But that would mean that Zelda Williams has a cousin named Zelda, which is possible. However, the question is about any cousins on her father's side, not necessarily the same name. \n\nIf Matt Williams has a daughter, then that daughter is a cousin to Zelda Williams. Therefore, the answer would be yes. However, I'm not certain if Matt Williams has children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Robin Williams had other siblings. For example, he had a sister named Sharon Williams, who was an actress. If Sharon had children, they would also be cousins. But I'm not sure about that. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the information that Robin Williams had a brother named Matt Williams, and if Matt has children, then Zelda Williams would have cousins on her father's side. However, without knowing for sure if Matt has children, it's a bit uncertain. But given that there's a daughter named Zelda associated with Matt Williams, it's possible that she is a cousin. Therefore, the answer might be yes. But I'm not entirely certain. However, given the confusion in names, maybe the answer is false. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nIf Matt Williams is Robin's brother and has a daughter, then that daughter is a cousin to Zelda. So the answer would be yes. But if Matt doesn't have any children, then no. Since I'm not sure, but based on the fact that there's a daughter named Zelda associated with Matt Williams, perhaps the answer is yes.

      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Zelda Williams has any cousins on her father's side. Let me start by recalling who Zelda Williams is. She's the daughter of Robert Williams, a famous comedian and actor, and Michelle Williams, the actress. \n\nNow, the key here is to determine if she has cousins on her father's side. That would mean looking at her father's siblings or their children. First, I need to check if Robert Williams had any siblings. If he did, then those siblings' children would be Zelda's cousins. \n\nI remember that Robert Williams was part of the Williams family, which includes the famous comedy duo, the Williamses.

Robert's father was Robert Williams Sr., and his mother was Virginia Williams. Robert had a brother named Jay Williams, who is a comedian. So Jay is Robert's brother.

So Bella is Zelda's cousin on her father's side. \n\nWait, but if Jay is Robert's brother, then Bella is Robert's niece, which would make her Zelda's cousin. So that would mean Zelda does have cousins on her father's side. However, I need to confirm if Jay has children. Yes, Jay and his wife have a daughter named Bella. Therefore, Bella is Zelda's cousin. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other cousins. But the key point is that since Robert has a brother (Jay), and Jay has children, those children are Zelda's cousins. So the answer would be yes. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's confusion here.

She's the daughter of actor Johnny Depp and his first wife, Amber Heard. So her father is Johnny Depp.\n\nNow, the question is about cousins on her father's side. That means we need to look into Johnny Depp's family. Let me think about Johnny Depp's relatives. I know he's from a family with some notable people. His mother is Wendy O. Cohen, and his father is Depp Sr., who was a painter. But wait, I'm not sure about his siblings. \n\nWait, Johnny Depp's father, Depp Sr., had a brother named John Depp, who was a musician. So if Johnny Depp has a paternal uncle, then that would mean that any children of that uncle would be Johnny's cousins. But I'm not certain if John Depp had any children. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other cousins through other branches. Let me check my memory. I think John Depp, the uncle, was a member of the band The Melodians. But I don't remember if he had any kids. If he did, then Zelda would have cousins through that line. However, if he didn't, then maybe there are no cousins on that side. \n\nAnother angle: Johnny Depp's father, Depp Sr., had a sister named Mary. If Mary had children, those would be cousins as well.
