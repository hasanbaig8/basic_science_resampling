      "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this. The question is asking if children's bicycles often have extra wheels. Hmm. I know that regular bicycles have two wheels. But sometimes, especially for kids, there are trikes or bikes with training wheels. Training wheels are those extra wheels that help kids learn to balance. So, maybe the answer is yes because those are extra wheels. But wait, are they considered \"often\"? Like, do most children's bikes have them? Or is it more common for them to have just two wheels? Wait, trikes do have three wheels, so that's an extra wheel. But maybe the answer depends on whether \"extra\" is considered beyond the standard two. So if the question is about having more than two wheels, then some children's bikes do. But are they \"often\"? I think trikes are a common type for toddlers, so maybe the answer is yes. But I should check if the question is about \"extra\" as in additional beyond the standard. So, if a bike has three wheels, then it has an extra wheel. So the answer would be yes. But maybe the answer is no because the question is about \"often.\" Wait, but maybe the majority of children's bikes are two-wheeled. However, there are many trikes and balance bikes which have three wheels. So maybe the answer is yes. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because most bikes are two-wheeled. Hmm. I need to decide based on common usage. I think the answer is yes, because trikes and bikes with training wheels are common, so they have extra wheels. So the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this question. The user is asking if children's bicycles often have extra wheels. Hmm, I need to figure out the answer.\n\nFirst, I know that regular bicycles have two wheels. But sometimes, especially for kids, there are tricycles. Tricycles have three wheels. So maybe the question is referring to those. But the question says \"extra wheels,\" which would mean more than the standard two. So, if a child's bike has three wheels, that's one extra. Are tricycles common for children?\n\nYes, I think tricycles are quite common for young children because they provide more stability. But are they considered \"bicycles\" or a different type of vehicle? The term \"bicycle\" usually refers to two wheels. So maybe tricycles are a separate category. However, the question is about children's bicycles. If tricycles are considered a type of bicycle, then the answer would be yes. But if the question is strictly about two-wheel bikes, then no. \n\nWait, the question says \"often have extra wheels.\" If tricycles are common, then the answer is yes. But maybe the user is thinking of bicycles with training wheels. Training wheels are temporary and not part of the standard design. So, do children's bicycles often come with extra wheels as a standard feature? Or are they only added temporarily?\n\nI think most children start with a tricycle, which has three wheels. But when they grow older, they might transition to a two-wheel bicycle. So, in that case, the answer could be yes, because tricycles are a type of children's bicycle with an extra wheel. But if the question is about bicycles (two wheels) with extra wheels, then no. \n\nThe key here is whether tricycles are considered bicycles. If they are, then the answer is yes. If not, then no. But generally, tricycles are considered a type of bicycle, even though they have three wheels. So, the answer would be yes. However, I need to check if \"often\" applies. Are tricycles common enough that it's considered \"often\"? I think they are, especially for toddlers. So the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this. The question is whether children's bicycles often have extra wheels. Hmm. First, I need to recall what I know about children's bikes. Typically, when I think of a children's bicycle, it's a standard two-wheeled bike, like the ones kids learn to ride on. But maybe there are exceptions.\n\nWait, sometimes there are tricycles for very young children. Tricycles have three wheels, right? So that's an extra wheel compared to a regular bike. But the question is about \"often\" having extra wheels. So if tricycles are common for toddlers, does that count as extra wheels? But the question specifies \"bicycles,\" which usually means two wheels. Tricycles might be considered a different category, like trikes instead of bikes. \n\nAlso, there are some bikes with training wheels, which are temporary extra wheels to help kids balance. But those are usually removed once the child is more skilled. So maybe those are considered extra wheels, but not permanent. But the question is about \"often\" having them. So if training wheels are common, then maybe the answer is yes. But I'm not sure if the question is referring to standard bicycles or including trikes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me. Because a bicycle by definition has two wheels, so adding extra would make it not a bicycle anymore. So maybe the answer is no. But if tricycles are considered bicycles, then the answer would be yes. But I think tricycles are typically called trikes, not bicycles. So maybe the answer is no. However, some sources might refer to tricycles as bicycles. \n\nWait, but the question is about \"often.\" If tricycles are a common type for children, then the answer would be yes. But I need to check if that's the case. For example, when a child is learning to ride, they might use a tricycle first, which has three wheels. But then, as they get older, they switch to a two-wheeled bike. So maybe tricycles are common for children, but they are not bicycles. Therefore, the answer would be no, because bicycles typically have two wheels. \n\nBut maybe the question is using \"bicycle\" in a broader sense. However, the term \"bicycle\" specifically refers to two wheels. So if the question is about bicycles, then the answer would be no. Unless the question is considering tricycles as bicycles, which might be a stretch. \n\nAnother angle: are there any other types of bicycles with extra wheels? Like maybe some specialty bikes? But I can't think of any. So the answer is probably no. But I need to be careful. If the question is asking whether children's bicycles often have extra wheels, and tricycles are considered bicycles, then yes. But if tricycles are not considered bicycles, then no. \n\nSo, to resolve this, I should check the definition. A bicycle is a vehicle with two wheels. A tricycle has three. So tricycles are not bicycles. Therefore, children's bicycles (two wheels) don't have extra wheels. However, if a child's bike has training wheels, those are extra, but they are temporary. So the answer depends on whether training wheels are considered \"extra wheels.\" If the question is about permanent extra wheels, then no. But if it's about temporary ones, maybe yes. \n\nBut the question is about \"often\" having extra wheels. So if training wheels are common, then the answer might be yes. But I think the majority of children's bicycles are two-wheeled. So the answer is probably no. However, I need to make sure. \n\nIn conclusion, since the standard children's bicycle has two wheels, and tricycles are a separate category, the answer would be no. Unless the question is considering tricycles as bicycles, which they aren't. Therefore, the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this. The question is asking if children's bicycles often have extra wheels. Hmm. So first, I need to recall what I know about children's bikes. Typically, when I think of a children's bicycle, they usually have two wheels, like a standard bike. But maybe there are exceptions.\n\nWait, sometimes kids might have training wheels. Oh right, training wheels are extra wheels that are attached to the back of a bicycle to help kids learn to balance. So those are extra wheels. But does that mean children's bicycles often have them? Or are they more of a temporary addition?\n\nI should consider how common training wheels are. I think they're pretty common for toddlers learning to ride. But once the child gets more skilled, they might remove them. So maybe the answer depends on whether \"often\" refers to the standard design or the common use. If the question is about the standard bicycle, then no, they don't have extra wheels. But if it's about the common practice of adding training wheels, then maybe yes. But the question is about \"children's bicycles\" in general. So maybe the answer is no, because the standard bicycle has two wheels, and extra wheels are added as an accessory, not part of the standard design. But I need to be careful here. Maybe some children's bikes come with training wheels as part of the design. Wait, I think most children's bikes are designed with two wheels, and training wheels are an optional add-on. So the answer would be no, because the bicycles themselves don't have extra wheels, but they can have them added. So the answer is false. But wait, maybe the question is considering that some children's bikes have three wheels. Wait, no, that's not common. Some strollers or baby joggers have three wheels, but those aren't bicycles. So the answer is no, children's bicycles don't often have extra wheels. Training wheels are separate. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this. The question is asking if children's bicycles often have extra wheels. Hmm, I need to recall what I know about children's bikes. \n\nFirst, regular bicycles have two wheels, right? But sometimes there are special types. Like, I remember seeing trikes for young kids. Trikes have three wheels. But are those considered extra wheels? Or is a trike just a different type of bike?\n\nWait, the question is about \"extra wheels\" meaning more than the standard two. So, if a child's bike has three wheels, that would be an extra one. But are trikes common for children? I think they are, especially for toddlers learning to ride. But maybe the question is referring to something else. \n\nAre there other types with extra wheels? Maybe some kids' bikes have training wheels? Training wheels are temporary, added to help balance. But those are usually not considered part of the standard bike. So, if the question is about whether they \"often\" have extra wheels, then maybe trikes are a common example. \n\nBut how often are trikes used compared to regular two-wheeled bikes? In some places, especially for very young children, trikes are common. But maybe the majority of children's bikes are two-wheeled. So, the answer might depend on whether trikes count as \"often\" having extra wheels. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me. Like, do children's bikes have extra wheels in addition to the standard two? For example, maybe some have a third wheel. But I think trikes are the main example. \n\nSo, if trikes are common, then the answer would be yes. If they are not common, then no. I need to decide based on general knowledge. From what I know, trikes are available for children, but they are not the most common type. Most children start with two-wheel bikes. However, trikes are a subset of children's bicycles. \n\nBut the question is about \"often\" having extra wheels. If \"often\" refers to a significant number, maybe trikes are not that common. Wait, but maybe in some regions or age groups, trikes are more common. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no, because the standard children's bike has two wheels, and extra wheels are not typical. But then again, trikes are a type of children's bike with an extra wheel. \n\nSo, the answer could be yes if trikes are considered, but maybe the question is looking for a no. I need to check if trikes are considered \"often\" or not. \n\nI think the answer is no. Because while trikes exist, they are not the majority. Most children's bicycles have two wheels. So the answer would be false. But I'm not 100% sure. Wait, maybe the question is considering that some children's bikes have training wheels, which are temporary. But training wheels are not part of the bike's standard design. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick. Like, do they have extra wheels as in additional wheels beyond the standard two? If so, then trikes would have one extra wheel. So, if trikes are common, then the answer is yes. But if they are not common, then no. \n\nI think the answer is no. Because the majority of children's bicycles are two-wheeled. Trikes are a subset, but not the majority. So, the answer would be false. But I'm a bit uncertain. Maybe I should look up some data, but since I can't, I'll go with my best judgment. \n\nFinal answer: {\"decision\": false}\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

But maybe some kids' bikes have training wheels? Oh right, training wheels are those extra wheels added to help kids learn to balance before they remove them. So, does that mean children's bicycles often have extra wheels?\n\nWait, but are training wheels considered \"extra wheels\" in the context of the question? The question says \"often have extra wheels.\" So if training wheels are common on children's bikes, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the question is referring to actual bicycles with more than two wheels, like a tricycle. Wait, tricycles have three wheels. But are tricycles considered bicycles? Or are they a separate category? \n\nWait, a bicycle is typically two wheels. A tricycle has three. So maybe the question is mixing up terms. But the user is asking about \"children's bicycles\" which might include tricycles. But are tricycles considered bicycles? Some sources might categorize them as bicycles, others as separate. So if a tricycle is considered a bicycle, then yes, they have an extra wheel. But if the question is about standard bicycles with two wheels, then no. \n\nBut the question is about \"extra wheels,\" so maybe they are referring to training wheels. So if children's bikes often have training wheels, then the answer is yes. But are training wheels common? I think they are often used when teaching kids to ride, so maybe that's the case. However, not all children's bikes have them. But the question is about \"often.\" So if it's common enough, then the answer is yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because most children's bicycles are standard two-wheelers, and the extra wheels (like training wheels) are temporary. So the answer might depend on whether training wheels count as \"extra wheels.\" If the question is about having an extra wheel beyond the standard two, then maybe the answer is no, because the standard is two. But if training wheels are considered, then yes. \n\nWait, but the term \"bicycle\" usually refers to two wheels. So if a child's bike has three wheels (a tricycle), then it's not a bicycle but a tricycle. So maybe the answer is no because the question is about bicycles, not tricycles. However, some people might refer to tricycles as bicycles. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check. According to some sources, a tricycle is a three-wheeled vehicle, while a bicycle has two. So if the question is about bicycles, then they don't have extra wheels. But if the question is about children's bikes, which can include tricycles, then maybe. But the question says \"bicycles,\" so the answer would be no. Unless training wheels are considered. \n\nBut training wheels are not part of the bike's standard structure.

      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether children's bicycles often have extra wheels. Let me think about this. I know that regular bicycles have two wheels. But sometimes, especially for kids, there are trikes or bikes with training wheels. Training wheels are those extra wheels that help kids learn to balance before they take off the front wheel. So, maybe the answer is yes because those are extra wheels. But wait, do they often have them? Or is it more common for kids to have two wheels?\n\nWait, the question is about \"often\" having extra wheels. So if a significant number of children's bicycles have extra wheels, then the answer would be yes. But maybe most children's bikes don't have them. Let me think. When kids start learning, they might use a trike or a bike with training wheels. But once they get better, they might remove the training wheels. So maybe it's common for them to have extra wheels during the learning phase, but not necessarily all the time. But the question is about \"often\" having them. So if there's a significant portion of children's bikes that have extra wheels, then the answer is yes. Alternatively, maybe the term \"extra wheels\" refers to more than two wheels, like a trike. But I think trikes are considered as having three wheels, which is an extra wheel compared to a regular bike. So if a lot of children's bikes are trikes, then the answer would be yes.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because most children's bikes have two wheels, and the extra wheels are not common. Hmm. I think I need to check common types of children's bikes. Let me recall. There are two-wheel bikes, three-wheel bikes (trikes), and some with training wheels. So, depending on the age, maybe some have extra wheels. But the question is about \"often.\" If it's a common feature, then yes. But I'm not sure if trikes are more common than two-wheelers. Maybe in some regions, trikes are more common for younger kids.

So, first, I need to recall what I know about children's bikes. \n\nI know that regular bicycles have two wheels, one in the front and one in the back. But sometimes, especially for very young children, there are trikes or bikes with three wheels. Those are called trikes. But are those considered \"extra wheels\" compared to a standard bicycle? \n\nWait, the question is about \"extra wheels\" beyond the standard two. So a trike would have one extra wheel.

So the answer might be yes. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. \n\nIn some regions, children's bikes with training wheels are common, but once they learn, they remove them. Trikes are another option. So, depending on the context, maybe sometimes they have extra wheels. But the question is about \"often.\" \n\nI think the answer is yes because trikes are a type of children's bicycle with three wheels, which is an extra wheel compared to a standard two-wheel bike. However, not all children's bicycles have extra wheels. But since trikes are a common type, the answer might be yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because most children's bikes are two-wheelers, and trikes are a subset.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this question. The user is asking if children's bicycles often have extra wheels. So, first, I need to recall what I know about children's bikes.\n\nI know that regular bicycles have two wheels, one at each end. But sometimes, especially for younger children, there are tricycles. Tricycles have three wheels. So maybe the question is referring to those. But the question says \"extra wheels,\" which implies more than the standard two. So tricycles would have one extra wheel. \n\nBut are tricycles considered \"often\" for children's bikes? I think that for very young kids, tricycles are common because they help with balance. But as children grow older, they might transition to regular bicycles. However, there are also some kids' bikes that have training wheels. Training wheels are temporary and are added to help with balance, but they're usually removed once the child is more skilled. So those would have an extra wheel as well. \n\nSo, if the question is about whether children's bicycles often have extra wheels, then the answer would be yes, because tricycles and training wheels are common.

So the answer might depend on that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of bicycles with more than three wheels, but that's not common. So the answer is yes, because tricycles and training wheels are extra wheels. But I need to confirm if \"often\" is accurate. \n\nIn some regions, tricycles are more common for toddlers, but in others, training wheels might be more common.

The term \"bicycle\" refers to a two-wheeled vehicle. A three-wheeled vehicle is a tricycle. So if the question is asking about bicycles (two wheels), then the answer is no.

But training wheels are typically temporary. However, some kids might have them for a while. So maybe the answer is yes. \n\nBut I'm not sure. The answer could vary. But I need to make a decision. Let me check some examples. For example, a typical children's bike might have two wheels, but some have three (tricycles) or have training wheels. So the answer could be yes if the question includes those. However, the term \"extra wheels\" might refer to additional wheels beyond the standard two. So, if a tricycle is considered, then yes, but if it's strictly two wheels, then no. \n\nBut the question is about \"children's bicycles,\" and tricycles are a type of children's vehicle.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because the primary bicycles have two wheels and extra wheels are not standard. Wait, the question is phrased as \"often have extra wheels.\" If training wheels are considered extra, then yes. But maybe the answer is no because the majority of children's bikes don't have them. I'm a bit torn. Let me think of examples. If a child's bike is a standard two-wheeler, then no. But if it's a trike, then no. But training wheels are added to a two-wheeler. So in that case, the answer is yes. But maybe the answer is no because the question is about bicycles, and adding extra wheels would make it not a bicycle. So, the answer might be no. Wait, the question is about children's bicycles. So if a child's bicycle has an extra wheel, it's a three-wheeler, which is not a standard bicycle. But some children's bikes are three-wheelers. However, the question is whether they \"often\" have extra wheels. So if some do, then yes. But if the majority are two-wheelers, then no.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this. The question is asking if children's bicycles often have extra wheels. Hmm, I know that regular bicycles have two wheels. But maybe some kids' bikes have training wheels? Wait, training wheels are those extra wheels that are attached to help kids learn to balance. But are they considered \"extra wheels\" in the sense of being additional beyond the standard two?\n\nSo, if a child's bicycle has training wheels, that would make it three wheels total. But are training wheels common on children's bikes? I think they are often used for toddlers or young children learning to ride. However, once the child gets older and more skilled, those training wheels are usually removed. So maybe it's not that common for children's bicycles to have extra wheels permanently. But the question is about \"often\" having them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some kids' bikes are designed with two wheels, but maybe some models have a third wheel. But I'm not sure if that's typical. Let me think. Most children's bikes I've seen have two wheels, with training wheels being an optional add-on. So maybe the answer is no, they don't often have extra wheels. But wait, the presence of training wheels would count as an extra wheel. So if training wheels are commonly used, then the answer would be yes. But are they considered \"often\" part of the bicycle? \n\nI think training wheels are more of a temporary feature, not a standard part. So maybe the answer is no. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check my knowledge. For example, when a child starts learning, they might have training wheels, but once they're more confident, they take them off. So maybe the answer is false because the bicycles don't usually have extra wheels as a standard. However, if the question is about whether they \"often\" have them, then maybe the answer is yes. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me. Because a bicycle typically has two wheels, so adding an extra would be three. But children's bikes might have different designs. Wait, some kids' bikes are three-wheelers, like trikes. But those are not bicycles. So maybe the answer is no, because bicycles are two-wheeled, and children's bicycles are the same. So the answer would be false. But I need to be careful. If the question is about \"extra wheels\" beyond the standard two, then the answer is no, because most children's bikes have two wheels. But if training wheels are considered part of the bike, then maybe they do have extra wheels. \n\nBut the term \"bicycle\" usually refers to two wheels. So if a bike has three wheels, it's not a bicycle. Therefore, children's bicycles are two-wheeled, so they don't have extra wheels. So the answer is false. But I need to confirm. For example, some kids' bikes might have training wheels, which are considered part of the bike. But in that case, they would have three wheels. However, the term \"bicycle\" is two wheels.

But I think trikes are considered as having three wheels, which is an extra wheel compared to a regular bike. So if a lot of children's bikes are trikes, then the answer would be yes. However, I'm not sure if trikes are considered as \"extra wheels\" in the context of the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to training wheels, which are temporary. So, perhaps the answer is yes because some children's bikes have training wheels, but the question is about \"often.\" I need to determine if it's common. Maybe the answer is yes because trikes are a common type of children's bike. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because most children's bikes have two wheels, and the extra wheels are not common. Hmm. I think I need to check common types of children's bikes. Let me recall. There are two-wheel bikes, three-wheel bikes (trikes), and some with training wheels. So, depending on the age, maybe some have extra wheels.

If trikes are a common type, then the answer would be yes. But if the majority of children's bikes are two-wheelers, then maybe not. \n\nI should check if trikes are a significant portion of children's bikes. From what I know, trikes are popular for toddlers and young children because they're easier to balance on. However, as kids grow, they might switch to regular two-wheel bikes. So maybe trikes are common but not the majority. But the question is about \"often\" having extra wheels. If a significant number of children's bikes have an extra wheel (as trikes), then the answer would be yes. Alternatively, if the majority are two-wheelers, then the answer is no. \n\nAnother angle: Are there any other types with extra wheels? Maybe some specialty bikes, but I don't think they're common. So, considering that trikes are a common type, the answer might be yes. However, the term \"bicycles\" typically refers to two-wheelers. Trikes might be considered a different category. So if the question is about bicycles (two-wheelers) with extra wheels, then the answer is no. But if trikes are included, then yes. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But the question says \"children's bicycles,\" so maybe trikes are included. So the answer would be yes, because trikes have an extra wheel. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because most children's bikes are two-wheelers, and the ones with extra wheels are not the norm. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is no. Because while trikes exist, they are not the majority. The standard child\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true. I was overthinking it before.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\n\nOkay, the question is asking if children's bicycles often have extra wheels. Let me think about this. I know that regular bicycles have two wheels. But sometimes, especially for kids, there are training wheels. Training wheels are those extra wheels that are attached to the back of a bicycle to help kids learn balancing. So, if the question is about whether they \"often\" have extra wheels, then maybe the answer is yes. But wait, are training wheels considered \"extra wheels\" in the context of the question? Also, are they common? I think many children's bikes do come with training wheels, especially when they're learning to ride. However, once they get better, those might be removed. So the answer might be yes, but I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to three-wheelers, like trikes. Some kids' bikes are three-wheelers, but those are not extra wheels on a standard bicycle. Wait, the question says \"bicycles,\" which typically have two wheels. So if they have extra wheels, that would be training wheels. So, the answer would be yes, because training wheels are extra and commonly added to children's bikes. But maybe the question is tricking me. Let me check. For example, a standard bicycle has two wheels. If a child's bike has an extra wheel, that's three. But are those considered \"often\"? I think training wheels are common, so the answer is yes. But maybe the answer is no because the primary bicycles have two wheels and extra wheels are not standard. Wait, but the question is about \"often have extra wheels.\" So if training wheels are common, then yes. However, maybe the answer is no because most children's bikes don't have extra wheels, but rather they have training wheels that are added. Hmm. I need to clarify. If a child's bicycle is a standard two-wheeler, then it doesn't have extra wheels. But if it's a training wheel bike, then it has an extra. So the answer depends on whether training wheels count as \"extra wheels.\" If they do, then yes, children's bicycles often have extra wheels. But if the question is about three-wheelers, then no, because those are different. Wait, the question says \"bicycles,\" which are two-wheeled. So if they have an extra wheel, that's three. So maybe the answer is no, because children's bicycles are typically two-wheeled, and extra wheels are not common. But I'm confused. Let me think again. Training wheels are sometimes added to a two-wheeler, making it three wheels temporarily. So in that case, the answer would be yes. But maybe the answer is no because the question is about \"often have extra wheels,\" and most children's bikes don't have them. For example, if a child is learning, the parent might add training wheels, but once they learn, they remove them. So maybe it's not common for children's bicycles to have extra wheels. Alternatively, if the question is referring to trikes, which are three-wheelers, but those are not bicycles. So the answer could be no. But I'm not sure. I need to check. Let me search my knowledge. I know that training wheels are common for children's bikes, but they are temporary. So the answer might be yes. But the question is about \"often have extra wheels.\" So if they are often added, then yes. But if the question is about standard bicycles, then no. Hmm. I think the answer is yes because training wheels are extra and often used for children's bikes. So the answer would be true. But I'm not 100% certain. Alt\n\nWait no, the answer is obviously true.

But are they considered \"extra wheels\" in the sense of being additional beyond the standard two?\n\nSo, if a child's bicycle has training wheels, that would make it three wheels total. But are training wheels common on children's bikes? I think they are often used for toddlers or young children learning to ride. However, once the child gets older and more skilled, those training wheels are usually removed. So maybe it's not that common for children's bicycles to have extra wheels permanently. But the question is about \"often\" having them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some kids' bikes are designed with two wheels, but maybe some models have a third wheel. But I'm not sure if that's typical. Let me think. Most children's bikes I've seen have two wheels, with training wheels being an optional add-on. So maybe the answer is no, they don't often have extra wheels. But wait, the presence of training wheels would count as an extra wheel. So if training wheels are commonly used, then the answer would be yes. But are they considered \"often\" part of the bicycle? \n\nI think training wheels are more of a temporary feature, not a standard part. So maybe the answer is no. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check my knowledge. For example, when a child starts learning, they might have training wheels, but once they're more confident, they take them off. So maybe the answer is false because the bicycles don't usually have extra wheels as a standard. However, if the question is about whether they \"often\" have them, then maybe the answer is yes.

But children's bikes might have different designs. Wait, some kids' bikes are three-wheelers, like trikes. But those are not bicycles.
