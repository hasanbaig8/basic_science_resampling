      "<think>\nOkay, the question is asking if Disney has an ice princess. Let me think about Disney characters. There's Elsa from Frozen, right? She's the ice queen, and she can create ice and snow. But the question specifically says \"ice princess.\" Elsa is often referred to as the Ice Queen, but maybe the term \"ice princess\" is different.\n\nWait, maybe they're referring to someone else. Let me recall other Disney characters. There's the Snow Queen from the Hans Christian Andersen story, which Disney adapted into \"Frozen.\" But in that story, Elsa is the Snow Queen, not the Ice Princess. Alternatively, maybe there's a character named Ice Princess in another Disney movie. \n\nWait, there's a Disney movie called \"The Princess and the Frog,\" but that's about a princess who's a frog. No, that's not it. What about \"Sleeping Beauty\"? Aurora is the princess, but she's not associated with ice. \n\nAnother thought: sometimes characters are called princesses in different contexts. Elsa is a princess in the Frozen universe, and she's associated with ice. So maybe the answer is yes, because Elsa is the ice princess. But I should check if \"ice princess\" is an official title. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is mixing up terms. The Snow Queen is a different title, but in Frozen, Elsa is the Snow Queen and also has ice powers. So maybe the answer is yes. But I need to be careful. If the question is using \"ice princess\" as a specific title, perhaps there's no such character. However, since Elsa is a princess and has ice powers, maybe that's considered an ice princess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another character. Wait, there's also the character of the Ice Princess in the movie \"Ice Princess,\" which is a Disney Channel Original Movie. Wait, no, \"Ice Princess\" is a movie that's not part of the Disney animated films. Wait, the Disney Channel movie \"Ice Princess\" (2005) stars Selena Gomez as a figure skater. But that's a live-action movie. However, the question is about Disney having an ice princess. So if that movie is considered part of Disney, then maybe the answer is yes. But the original question might be referring to animated characters. \n\nBut the user didn't specify, so maybe the answer is yes because there's the character in the movie \"Ice Princess\" (2005) and also Elsa from Frozen. However, I need to confirm if Elsa is considered an ice princess. Since she's the Snow Queen and has ice powers, but the term \"ice princess\" might not be official. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because there's no official Disney character named Ice Princess. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if Disney has an ice princess, not necessarily a character named Ice Princess. So if there's a character associated with ice and princess, like Elsa, then the answer would be yes. However, the term \"ice princess\" might not be the official title. But the question is phrased as \"ice princess\" as a title. So maybe the answer is no, because there's no official character named Ice Princess. But Elsa is a princess with ice powers. So maybe the answer is yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the Ice Queen, which is a different title. So this is a bit ambiguous. But given that Elsa is a princess with ice powers, it's possible that the answer is yes. However, I need to check if the term \"ice princess\" is used for her. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the Snow Queen, which is a different title. So maybe the answer is no. But I'm getting confused here. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on interpretation. However, the most likely answer is that Disney does have an ice princess, referring to Elsa from Frozen. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, the question is asking if Disney has an ice princess. Let me think. First, I need to recall Disney characters associated with ice or princess themes. There's Elsa from Frozen, right? She's the ice princess. But wait, is she considered a princess in the traditional sense? In Frozen, Elsa is the princess of Arendelle. So yes, she's a Disney princess and has ice powers. Then there's the movie \"Frozen,\" which is a Disney film. So the answer should be yes. But maybe the user is thinking of a different one? Like maybe someone else? But I can't think of another Disney ice princess. So I think the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, the question is asking if Disney has an ice princess. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall Disney characters associated with ice or princess themes.\n\nThere's Elsa from Frozen, right? She's the ice princess. Frozen is a Disney movie, so Elsa would be a Disney character. But wait, the question is phrased as \"ice princess\" in general. Are there other Disney princesses associated with ice? Maybe not. Let me check. The traditional Disney princesses like Snow White, Aurora, Ariel, etc., don't have ice themes. Elsa is the main one from Frozen. So the answer would be yes, because Elsa is an ice princess in Disney. But wait, does the term \"ice princess\" specifically refer to a character? Or is it a title? Maybe the user is asking if there's a princess character in Disney who is associated with ice. Since Elsa is the ice queen and has ice powers, she fits the ice princess description. So the answer should be yes. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

Frozen was released in 2013, and Elsa is the princess of Arendelle. She has ice powers. So yes, Disney does have an ice princess.

      "<think>\nOkay, the question is asking if Disney has an ice princess. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Disney characters related to ice or princesses. The most famous one is Elsa from Frozen. She's the ice queen, right? But the question says \"ice princess.\" Elsa is often referred to as the Snow Queen or Ice Queen, but maybe people also call her an ice princess. Wait, the term \"princess\" might be a bit different. In Disney, princesses are usually royal characters, like Aurora, Ariel, or Elsa. But Elsa's title is more about her powers with ice. \n\nWait, there's also the character from \"The Snow Queen\" which is a Disney film. The original story by Hans Christian Andersen has a girl named Gerda who tries to save a prince from the Snow Queen. But Disney adapted that into \"Frozen,\" where Elsa becomes the Snow Queen. So maybe the answer is yes, because Elsa is an ice princess. But does Disney have an official \"ice princess\" title? Or is it more accurate to say she's the Snow Queen? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of another character. But I don't recall any other Disney princesses associated with ice. So the answer is likely yes, as Elsa is considered an ice princess. Therefore, the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

First, I need to recall Disney characters associated with ice or princess themes.\n\nThere's Elsa from Frozen, right? She's the Snow Queen and has ice powers. But is she considered an \"ice princess\"? The term \"ice princess\" might be more associated with someone like the Snow Queen in the original fairy tale, but Disney's Frozen reimagines that. Elsa is a princess and has ice abilities, so maybe that's the connection. However, the term \"ice princess\" might also refer to other characters. Wait, there's also the character of the Ice Queen from the 1950s Disney film \"The Sword in the Stone,\" but that's not a princess. Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the Snow Queen from the original story, which Disney adapted in Frozen. So, in that case, Elsa could be considered an ice princess. But I need to check if Disney has an official \"ice princess\" character. Alternatively, maybe there's a specific character named \"Ice Princess\" in a Disney movie. Let me think. There's a movie called \"Ice Princess\" which is a Disney film, but it's based on a true story about a figure skater. The main character is a girl who becomes a figure skater, but she's not a princess. So that's a different context. So, the answer might depend on whether \"ice princess\" refers to Elsa from Frozen or another character. Since the question is about Disney having an ice princess, and Elsa is a Disney princess with ice powers, the answer is likely yes. But I need to confirm if there's an official title or if it's a common nickname. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the Snow Queen from Frozen, who is Elsa. So, the answer would be yes. But I should also consider if there's any other character. Wait, there's also the character of the Ice Princess in the 1996 movie \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" but that's not a Disney princess. So, in conclusion, the main answer would be yes, Disney has an ice princess, referring to Elsa from Frozen.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

But wait, the question is about an \"ice princess.\" Maybe they're referring to Elsa. But I should check if there's another character. Like, maybe someone else? I can't think of another Disney princess who's specifically an ice princess. The term \"ice princess\" might be more of a nickname or a specific character. \n\nWait, in some contexts, \"ice princess\" could refer to a character like the Snow Queen from the Hans Christian Andersen story, but that's not a Disney original. Disney did adapt that into Frozen, but Elsa is the main character there. So, if the question is asking if Disney has a character that is an ice princess, then Elsa would fit. But maybe the answer is no because \"ice princess\" isn't an official title for any Disney character. Or maybe it's considered a nickname. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different character. For example, in some other Disney movies, there might be a princess associated with ice. But I don't recall any. Let me think again. Frozen is the main one. So, Elsa is a princess with ice powers. So, does that make her an ice princess? It depends on interpretation. If the question is literal, maybe not, but if it's more metaphorical, then yes. \n\nBut the answer is likely expecting a yes because Elsa is a princess and has ice-related abilities. However, the term \"ice princess\" isn't an official title. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because there's no character specifically named \"Ice Princess\" in Disney. Wait, there's a Disney movie called \"The Ice Princess,\" which is a live-action film. But that's not a princess character. The movie is about a girl who becomes a figure skater, but the title might be confusing. \n\nSo, if the question is about a Disney character who is an ice princess, then maybe the answer is yes, referring to Elsa. But if the question is about a character named \"Ice Princess,\" then it's different. The user might be referring to the movie \"The Ice Princess,\" but that's not a princess character. \n\nI think the intended answer here is no because there's no official Disney princess named \"Ice Princess.\" However, Elsa is sometimes called an ice princess. But the question is phrased as \"Does Disney have an ice princess?\" So, if \"ice princess\" is a nickname for Elsa, then the answer is yes. But if it's asking for a character with that exact title, then no. \n\nI need to decide based on common knowledge. Elsa from Frozen is widely known as an ice princess, so the answer is likely yes. But I should check if there's any other character. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because the term isn't officially used. \n\nWait, the user might be confused. Let me think again. The question is ambiguous. But given that Elsa is a princess and associated with ice, the answer is probably yes. So the JSON would be {\"decision\": true}. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is false because there's no character named \"Ice Princess\" in Disney. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. But I think the answer is yes, because Elsa is considered an ice princess. So the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

She's the ice princess. But wait, is she considered an \"ice princess\" in the traditional sense? The term might refer to a character known for ice-related powers or being a princess. Elsa definitely has ice powers and is a princess in the story. \n\nAre there other Disney princesses associated with ice? Maybe someone like Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, but she's more associated with a magical sleep than ice. Or maybe someone else? Let me think. The term \"ice princess\" might be more of a nickname or a specific title. \n\nIn the context of Disney, Elsa is often referred to as the Ice Queen, and her kingdom is Arendelle. The movie Frozen is a Disney film, so she's part of Disney's canon. Therefore, the answer would be yes, Disney does have an ice princess, which is Elsa. \n\nBut wait, the question might be using \"ice princess\" as a specific title. Maybe there's another character?

But wait, there's also the Snow Queen from the Hans Christian Andersen story, which Disney adapted into Frozen. So Elsa is the Snow Queen, which makes her an ice princess. But does Disney have an ice princess as a character? Yes, Elsa fits that description. However, maybe the question is looking for a different character. Let me check other possibilities. Are there any other Disney princesses known for ice? Maybe not. So the answer would be yes. But wait, maybe the user is thinking of the original Snow Queen, but Disney's version is Elsa.

      "<think>\nOkay, the question is asking if Disney has an ice princess. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I should recall Disney's princesses. The most famous ones are from their animated films.

Wait, but none of these are specifically called \"Ice Princess.\" \n\nWait, there's a movie called \"Ice Princess\" which is a live-action film, but is it a Disney movie? Let me check. The Ice Princess movie was released in 2005, and it's based on a true story about a girl who becomes a figure skater. But I think that film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures. So maybe that's considered a Disney movie. However, the main character is not a princess in the traditional sense. The title might be confusing here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to Elsa from Frozen. Elsa is the ice princess in the movie Frozen, which is a Disney film. But the question is phrased as \"ice princess,\" not \"ice queen\" or \"princess of ice.\" However, Elsa is the queen of Arendelle and has ice powers. But the title \"Ice Princess\" might not be an official title for any Disney character. \n\nWait, the user is asking if Disney has an ice princess. So, if there's a character in any Disney movie that is referred to as the Ice Princess, then the answer is yes. But if not, then no. \n\nLooking at the list of Disney princesses, none of them are called Ice Princess. However, the movie \"Ice Princess\" is a Disney film, but the main character isn't a princess. So the answer might be no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a confusion between the movie and the princess. The user might be thinking of Elsa as the Ice Princess, but she's not officially called that. The title \"Ice Princess\" is more associated with the movie. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be no, Disney does not have an ice princess as a character, but they do have a movie titled Ice Princess. But the question is about a princess, not a movie. So the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

Wait, no, actually, the Disney movie \"Ice Princess\" is a 2005 film starring Hilary Duff. However, the main character, Taylor, is a figure skater, not a princess. So that might not be the one. \n\nAlternatively, there's the character of Bianca from the Disney animated film \"The Princess and the Frog,\" but she's not an ice princess. Then there's the Snow Queen from \"The Snow Queen,\" but that's a different story. Wait, the Snow Queen is a character from Hans Christian Andersen's story, which Disney adapted into a movie called \"The Snow Queen\" in 1986. The main character is Gerda, who is a girl, but the Snow Queen is a character who is associated with ice. However, the Snow Queen isn't referred to as an \"ice princess\" in the Disney version. \n\nSo, going back, Elsa from Frozen is definitely a princess and has ice powers, so she's the ice princess.

I can't think of any others. The term \"ice princess\" might be more commonly associated with Elsa. So I think the answer is yes. But I should make sure there's no other character. Let me check my memory. There's the Snow Queen from a Disney movie, but that's from \"The Snow Queen\" which is a different story.

The term \"ice princess\" might refer to someone who is associated with ice, like in a story or a movie.\n\nWait, there's also the story of \"The Ice Princess\" which is a Disney Channel Original Movie. The main character is a figure skater named Lacey, who is determined to become a professional ice skater. But is that considered a Disney princess? The term \"princess\" might be a bit misleading here. The movie is called \"The Ice Princess,\" but the character isn't a princess in the traditional sense. She's a young athlete.\n\nThen there's Elsa from Frozen, who is a princess and has ice powers. She's definitely a Disney princess and associated with ice. So maybe the answer depends on how strictly we interpret \"ice princess.\" If the question is looking for a princess character associated with ice, then Elsa would be the answer. But if it's asking for a character specifically named \"Ice Princess\" or a title, then maybe the movie character. But the movie's character isn't a princess, just a figure skater.\n\nWait, the original question is phrased as \"Does Disney have an ice princess?\" So maybe they are referring to a princess character who is an ice princess. In that case, Elsa from Frozen would fit. But I should check if there are any other characters. For example, in some of the older Disney movies, there might be characters associated with ice, but I can't recall any. The Ice Princess movie is a more recent one, but it's a Disney Channel movie, not a Disney Princess film. The Disney Princess line includes characters like Snow White, Aurora, etc., but not necessarily ice princesses.\n\nSo, considering that Elsa is a Disney princess and has ice powers, she might be considered an ice princess. However, the term \"ice princess\" is more commonly associated with the movie \"The Ice Princess,\" which is a different context. But since the question is about Disney having an ice princess, and Elsa is a Disney princess with ice-related abilities, the answer would be yes.

No, she's a mermaid, not an ice princess.\n\nAnother angle: Are there any Disney movies where a character is explicitly called an \"ice princess\"? The term might be used in fan communities or merchandise, but officially? Elsa is the closest. However, \"ice princess\" isn't her official title. The term might be more commonly used for her. So maybe the answer is yes, but I need to check if Disney officially recognizes her as such.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to a specific character. For example, in some stories, a \"princess\" could be associated with ice, but Disney's official roster includes Elsa as the Snow Queen. So, depending on interpretation, the answer could be yes.

But wait, is she considered a princess in the traditional sense? In Frozen, Elsa is the princess of Arendelle. So she does hold the title of princess. Plus, her powers involve ice, so that fits the \"ice princess\" description. \n\nAre there any other Disney characters that might fit this? Maybe someone like Rapunzel, but she's more associated with towers and hair, not ice. Or maybe the Snow Queen from some Disney films? Wait, there's a Disney movie called \"Frozen\" which is about Elsa and Anna. The Snow Queen is a character from the Hans Christian Andersen story, but Disney adapted that into Frozen.

So that would mean yes, Disney does have an ice princess.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is thinking of another character? Like maybe someone from a different Disney property? Let me think.

The most obvious one is Elsa from Frozen. She's the Ice Queen, right? But the question says \"ice princess.\" Elsa is a princess, and she can create ice, so maybe that's what they're referring to. But wait, is there another character? Let me think. There's also the Snow Queen from the Hans Christian Andersen story, which Disney adapted into Frozen. So Elsa is the Ice Queen, but the term \"ice princess\" might be a bit different. However, in the context of Disney, Elsa is the most prominent character associated with ice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the Snow Queen from the original story, but Disney's version is Frozen. So yes, Elsa is considered an ice princess. But I need to confirm if \"ice princess\" is an official title. The term \"Ice Princess\" might also refer to a different movie, like the 2008 film \"Ice Princess,\" which is about a figure skater, but that's not a Disney film. Wait, no, \"Ice Princess\" is a Disney movie? Let me check. Actually, \"Ice Princess\" is a Disney Channel Original Movie released in 2008, starring Hilary Duff. So that's a different character, but the main character is a figure skater, not an ice princess. \n\nSo the question is whether Disney has an ice princess. If we consider Elsa from Frozen, she is the Ice Queen, which is a princess. So the answer would be yes. But maybe the user is looking for a different answer. Alternatively, maybe the term \"ice princess\" isn't officially used for any Disney character. However, given that Elsa is the Ice Queen, and she's a princess, it's possible that the answer is yes. \n\nAlternatively, if \"ice princess\" is a specific term that Disney hasn't used, then the answer might be no.

Then there are the more recent ones like Elsa from Frozen, Rapunzel from Tangled, and Merida from Brave.\n\nNow, the term \"ice princess\" might refer to a character known for being associated with ice. Elsa from Frozen is the most obvious one because she has ice powers and is often called the Ice Queen. But does Disney officially refer to her as an ice princess? Let me check. In Frozen, Elsa is the Snow Queen, and her kingdom is Arendelle. The term \"ice princess\" is more of a nickname or a common term used by fans. However, the question is whether Disney has an ice princess. Since Elsa is a princess and has ice-related abilities, it's possible that the answer is yes. But I should make sure there isn't another character. Maybe someone like the Snow Queen from another movie? But Disney's Snow Queen is from a different movie, and I think that's not as well-known.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if Disney has an ice princess. Hmm. First, I need to think about Disney characters. There's Elsa from Frozen, right? She's the ice princess. But wait, is she considered an \"ice princess\" in the traditional sense? Or is that a specific title?\n\nWait, the term \"ice princess\" might refer to a specific character. Let me recall. In Disney's Frozen, Elsa is a princess who can create ice and snow. She's often referred to as the Ice Queen, but maybe \"ice princess\" is a nickname. Alternatively, there's the character of Princess Anna, but she's not associated with ice in the same way. \n\nWait, maybe there's another Disney movie. Like, maybe a princess from an older movie? I'm not sure. Let me think. There's also the Snow Queen from the Hans Christian Andersen story, which Disney adapted into Frozen. So Elsa is based on that. So in that case, Elsa would be the ice princess. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"Does Disney have an ice princess?\" So if Elsa is considered an ice princess, then the answer is yes. But maybe the term is more specific. Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different character. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because \"ice princess\" isn't an official title, but rather a nickname. But the question is asking if Disney has such a character. Since Elsa is a princess with ice powers, maybe the answer is yes. \n\nWait, but maybe the user is thinking of the Ice Princess from a different Disney movie. Let me check my memory. There's a movie called \"The Ice Princess\" which is a Disney Channel Original Movie, but I think that's not part of the main Disney Princess line. The main Disney Princesses are like Elsa, Anna, Aurora, etc. \n\nSo, if the question is about the main Disney Princess line, then Elsa would be the answer. But if it's about any Disney character, then maybe the Ice Princess from the movie. However, the user might be referring to the main princesses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because \"ice princess\" isn't an official title. But I think Elsa is commonly referred to as the Ice Queen, and the term \"ice princess\" might be a colloquial term. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is yes, Disney has an ice princess, referring to Elsa from Frozen. So the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

She's the ice princess. But wait, is she considered an \"ice princess\" in the traditional sense? Or is that a specific term used here?\n\nWait, the term \"ice princess\" might refer to someone who is associated with ice, like in a kingdom or having ice powers. Elsa is the queen of Arendelle and can create ice and snow. So she's definitely an ice princess. But maybe the user is thinking of another character?\n\nAlternatively, there's the character from the 1950s called \"The Ice Princess\" which was a live-action film, but that's not a Disney animated character. But the question is about Disney, so maybe they're referring to the animated ones.\n\nAnother possibility is the Snow Queen from the Hans Christian Andersen story, which Disney adapted into \"Frozen.\" But Elsa is the main character there.

She's the ice princess. But wait, is she considered an \"ice princess\" in the traditional sense? The term might refer to a character who is associated with ice or cold, like in a fairy tale. \n\nIn the original Frozen movie, Elsa is the princess of Arendelle and has ice powers. The term \"ice princess\" might be a nickname or a title given to her. But does Disney officially refer to her as an ice princess? Maybe in the context of the movie, she's called that. \n\nAlternatively, there's the character of the Ice Princess from the Disney movie \"The Ice Princess,\" which is a live-action film released in 2005. That movie is about a girl who becomes a figure skater and deals with ice-related themes. However, that movie is less well-known compared to Frozen. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the interpretation. If the question is asking about a character known as an ice princess, then Elsa from Frozen is the answer. But if it's asking for a specific title or a more traditional ice princess, maybe the answer is different. However, given that \"The Ice Princess\" is a Disney movie, even if it's a live-action film, the answer would still be yes. \n\nWait, but the user might be referring to a princess character associated with ice, like Elsa.

But does Disney officially refer to her as an ice princess? Maybe in some merchandise or stories. Alternatively, there's the character of Bianca from Disney's \"The Princess and the Frog,\" but she's not an ice princess. Wait, no, Bianca is a jazz singer. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the user is referring to the original \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" but the princess there is Snow White, not an ice princess. There's also the character of Rapunzel, but she's not associated with ice. \n\nWait, maybe the user is thinking of the 1950s animated film \"The Ice Princess,\" but I don't recall that being a Disney film. Disney has a movie called \"Frozen,\" which is about Elsa, and she's associated with ice. So even though the term \"ice princess\" might not be official, Elsa is a princess with ice powers. So the answer would be yes. But I need to be careful here. The question is whether Disney has an ice princess. If \"ice princess\" is a title or role, then Elsa fits.

Alternatively, maybe there's another character. \n\nWait, maybe the user is confused between \"The Ice Princess\" and Disney's \"Frozen.\" But \"The Ice Princess\" is a 2005 film, not a Disney one.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check. Oh, maybe the user is thinking of the 2007 film \"Enchanted,\" where the character Giselle is a princess, but that's not related to ice.\n\nWait, there's also the character of the Ice Princess in the Disney animated short \"The Ice Princess\" (1994), which is a short film. But I'm not sure if that's considered a main character. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to Elsa as the Ice Princess. Since Frozen is a Disney movie and Elsa is a princess who can control ice, it's possible that the answer is yes. However, the term \"ice princess\" might not be an official title, but the character is often associated with ice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confusing with the \"Snow Queen\" from the Hans Christian Andersen story, which was adapted into a Disney film called \"Frozen.\" In that case, Elsa is the Snow Queen, but the term \"ice princess\" might be a different character. Wait, no, Elsa is the main character in Frozen. So the answer might be yes, Disney does have an ice princess, referring to Elsa. But I need to be careful here.

Or maybe the user is thinking of the Ice Princess in the \"Hercules\" movie? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, the term \"ice princess\" might refer to a different character. But given that Frozen is a major Disney film and Elsa is a princess with ice powers, it's likely that the answer is yes. However, the exact term \"ice princess\" might not be used officially.

Wait, no, actually, \"The Ice Princess\" is a 2005 film that's not produced by Disney. Disney has a character named Elsa, but she's more of an ice queen. Then there's the Snow Queen from the Hans Christian Andersen story, which Disney adapted into \"Frozen.\" But the term \"ice princess\" might not be an official Disney title.
