      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Hawaiian cuisine embraces foods that are considered gross in the continental US. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"gross\" means here. It's probably referring to foods that are considered unpleasant, maybe with strong smells, slimy textures, or something that's not typically eaten in the mainland US. \n\nHawaiian cuisine is known for things like poke bowls, kalua pig, plate lunches, and tropical fruits. These are generally seen as healthy and flavorful. But maybe there are some local dishes that are considered gross by some people. For example, I've heard that some traditional dishes might include things like raw fish (which is okay in poke, but maybe not in other contexts) or certain fermented foods. \n\nWait, but is there a specific food in Hawaii that's considered gross by the continental US? Maybe something like inari sushi? No, that's more of a Japanese dish. Or maybe the use of certain ingredients like octopus or squid? Those might be considered gross by some. But are they part of Hawaiian cuisine? \n\nWait, maybe the answer is no. Because Hawaiian cuisine is a mix of indigenous Polynesian and other influences, but the dishes that are popular in Hawaii are usually not considered gross. However, if there are certain traditional foods that are considered gross, but the question is about whether the cuisine as a whole embraces them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to foods that are considered gross in the continental US but are part of Hawaiian culture. For example, maybe something like the use of certain types of seafood or plants. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes \"gross\" is subjective. For instance, some people might find the use of certain ingredients like fermented foods or strong-smelling herbs to be gross. But in Hawaii, these are part of the cuisine. However, I don't think that's the case. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is no. Because Hawaiian cuisine is generally seen as more health-conscious and uses fresh ingredients. The foods that are considered gross in the continental US, like certain processed foods or fast food, aren't part of the traditional Hawaiian cuisine. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are some dishes that are considered gross by some. For example, the use of pig in certain ways, but that's not necessarily gross. Or maybe the use of certain local plants that are not common in the mainland. \n\nBut I think the answer is no. The cuisine of Hawaii doesn't embrace foods that are considered gross in the continental US. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US. First, I need to think about what Hawaiian food typically includes. I know that Hawaii has a mix of influences, like Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and Native Hawaiian dishes. Common dishes might be things like poke bowls, kalua pork, spam musubi, and shave ice. \n\nNow, considering what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. The term \"gross\" is subjective, but maybe the user is referring to foods that are seen as unusual or unappetizing. For example, spam is a processed meat that's popular in Hawaii but might be considered gross by some people in the mainland US. However, not everyone would find it gross. \n\nAnother example could be things like octopus or certain seafood that might be less common in the mainland. But I need to check if these are actually part of Hawaiian cuisine. Also, dishes like pig roasts (kalua pork) are traditional but might be considered unconventional in some places. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the cuisine embraces such foods. So, even if some dishes are seen as gross by some, if they are part of the local cuisine and accepted there, the answer would be yes. But I should verify if these foods are indeed considered gross in the continental US. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of something like raw fish (sashimi) or certain fermented foods. But again, these are part of Hawaiian cuisine and not necessarily gross. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to foods that are considered unappetizing or have a bad reputation. For example, spam is a processed meat that's high in sodium and might be seen as less healthy, but it's a staple in Hawaii. So even if some people find it gross, the cuisine does include it. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be yes. However, I need to be cautious. If the question is about foods that are universally considered gross, then maybe not. But since the question is about embracing such foods, and Hawaii does include items like spam, which are considered gross by some, the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I should also consider that \"gross\" is subjective. Maybe the user is referring to something more specific. However, based on general knowledge, the answer is likely yes. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Hawaiian cuisine embraces foods that are considered gross in the continental US. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"gross\" means here. Gross foods might be those that are considered unappetizing, strange, or culturally off-putting. But I should consider the context of Hawaiian cuisine and how it's perceived in the continental US.\n\nHawaiian food includes dishes like poke, spam musubi, kalua pig, and shave ice. Now, some of these might be considered unusual by people from the continental US. For example, spam is a canned meat product that's a staple in Hawaii, but it's not commonly eaten elsewhere. Some people might find it unappetizing. Similarly, dishes like laulau (wrapped in taro leaves) or certain seafood preparations might be viewed differently.\n\nHowever, the term \"gross\" is subjective. What's considered gross in the continental US might not be the case in Hawaii. Also, Hawaiian cuisine is part of the broader Pacific Islander cuisine, which has its own cultural significance. The question is whether the cuisine embraces these foods, not whether they are gross in general. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"foods considered gross in the continental US.\" So if those foods are embraced in Hawaii, then the answer would be yes. But if the foods are not considered gross in Hawaii, then no. \n\nWait, but the question is about whether the cuisine of Hawaii embraces foods that are considered gross in the continental US. So it's about whether Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are deemed gross in the continental US. For example, if a food is considered gross in the continental US but is part of Hawaiian cuisine, then the answer would be yes. \n\nBut are there such foods? Let me think. Spam is a good example. In the continental US, some people might find spam unappealing, but in Hawaii, it's a beloved staple. So if spam is considered gross in the continental US, then Hawaii's cuisine does embrace it. However, if \"gross\" is a strong term, maybe some people might not consider spam as gross. \n\nAnother example could be certain traditional dishes. For instance, some dishes might involve ingredients that are not commonly used in the continental US, but that's not necessarily gross. It's more about cultural preferences. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the foods in question are actually considered gross in the continental US. But the question is phrased as if there's a general acceptance. However, the answer might be no, because Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are unique to the region, but not necessarily considered gross. Alternatively, if the question is implying that certain foods are considered gross in the continental US but embraced in Hawaii, then the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I need to check if there's a consensus. For example, spam is a cultural staple in Hawaii, but in the continental US, it's often viewed as a processed meat that's not as popular. So some might find it gross, but others might not. However, the question is about whether the cuisine embraces such foods. Since spam is a part of Hawaiian cuisine, even if some people find it gross, the cuisine does include it. So the answer would be yes. \n\nWait, but the question is whether the cuisine embraces foods that are considered gross. So if those foods are part of the cuisine, then the answer is yes. But if the foods are not considered gross in the continental US, then no. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"foods considered gross in the continental US.\" So the answer would be yes if there are foods that are considered gross in the continental US but embraced in Hawaii. For example, spam is a case. So the answer would be yes. However, maybe the answer is no because \"gross\" is a subjective term and not all foods that are considered gross are embraced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because Hawaiian cuisine is not known for embracing foods that are considered gross. But I think spam is a good example. So the answer is yes. \n\nBut I need to verify. Let me think of other examples. Another example could be certain traditional dishes like raw fish (sashimi), but that's more Japanese. However, in Hawaii, they have poke, which is similar. Some people in the continental US might find raw fish unappetizing, but in Hawaii, it's a staple. \n\nSo, in that case, the answer would be yes. Therefore, the answer is true. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is false if the term \"gross\" is not widely accepted. But the question is asking for a yes/no answer based on the cuisine embracing such foods. \n\nSo, the answer would be yes. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US.

Examples could be things like raw meat, certain types of fermented foods, or maybe some seafood.\n\nNow, thinking about Hawaiian cuisine. Hawaii has a mix of influences, including Native Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific Islander foods. Common dishes might include things like poke bowls, kalua pig, plate lunches with spam, rice, and macaroni salad. There's also the use of tropical fruits like pineapples, which are a big part of Hawaiian culture.\n\nWait, but what about foods that might be considered gross in the continental US? For example, in some parts of the US, certain seafood like raw fish (sushi) or dishes with strong flavors might be viewed differently. However, in Hawaii, these are quite common and not considered gross. Also, dishes like Spam, which is a processed meat, is a staple in Hawaii but might be seen as odd in some US regions. However, the question is about whether they \"embrace\" such foods, meaning they are part of their cuisine.\n\nAnother angle: Are there any traditional Hawaiian foods that are considered gross in the continental US? Maybe things like certain fermented foods or dishes with strong ingredients. But I don't recall any Hawaiian dishes that are universally considered gross. Instead, they're often seen as unique or flavorful. For example, the use of taro, which is a root vegetable, might be unfamiliar to some, but it's a staple in Hawaiian cooking.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"gross\" is subjective. What's gross to one person might be normal to another. So, the answer might depend on cultural perceptions. However, in general, Hawaiian cuisine is known for its fresh, tropical ingredients and is not typically associated with foods that are considered unappetizing in the continental US.

First, I need to understand what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. Typically, \"gross\" might refer to foods that are perceived as unappetizing, maybe due to texture, appearance, or cultural unfamiliarity. \n\nHawaiian cuisine is known for dishes like poke, spam, kalua pig, and tropical fruits. Now, let's think about each. Poke is raw fish, which might be considered gross by some, but it's a traditional dish. Spam is a canned meat product that's popular in Hawaii, though it's not common in the continental US. Kalua pig is slow-cooked and often marinated, which might be seen as unusual.

For instance, dishes like ina moa (which is a traditional dish made from fermented fish) might be seen as gross. But is that a common part of Hawaiian cuisine? Or is it more of a traditional dish that's not widely consumed? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no. Hawaiian cuisine has its own unique dishes, but they are not typically considered gross. The term \"gross\" is subjective, and while some foods might be considered unusual, they are part of the culture. So the answer might be false. But I need to be careful here. \n\nI should also consider that some foods like spam are actually popular in Hawaii but might be seen as odd in the continental US. However, the question is about whether they are considered \"gross.\" If \"gross\" is defined as something that is physically unappealing or culturally offensive, then maybe not. \n\nIn conclusion, while some Hawaiian dishes might be considered unusual or unappetizing by some people in the continental US, they are not generally considered \"gross\" in the sense of being repulsive or offensive.

Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"gross\" means in this context. Gross usually refers to something that is unappetizing, revolting, or unpleasant. But what foods are considered gross in the continental US? Maybe things like certain types of fast food, processed meats, or maybe some traditional dishes that are not widely accepted. But I need to check if Hawaii's cuisine includes any of those.\n\nHawaiian cuisine is a mix of indigenous Hawaiian foods and influences from other cultures, like Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and others, due to the history of colonization and immigration. Traditional Hawaiian dishes include things like poi (made from taro), kalua pig (slow-cooked pork), and various seafood dishes. There's also a lot of fusion cuisine, like plate lunches which include rice, meat, and a vegetable.\n\nNow, are any of these traditional Hawaiian dishes considered gross in the continental US? Poi is a staple in Hawaiian cuisine, but it's made from fermented taro, which might be unfamiliar to some people. However, it's not typically considered gross. Kalua pig is a delicacy, so it's more of a specialty than something gross. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe some fusion dishes or certain street foods that are popular in Hawaii, like spam musubi (which is a rice cake with spam and seaweed), could be seen as gross by some people. Spam is a processed meat that's not popular everywhere, but in Hawaii, it's a beloved part of the cuisine. However, the question is about whether the cuisine \"embrace\" foods considered gross. If some people find spam or certain dishes gross, but the cuisine includes them, then the answer might be yes.

For example, some traditional Hawaiian dishes might use ingredients that are not common in the mainland US, like certain types of fish or specific cooking methods. But I don't think those are considered gross, just different.\n\nWait, maybe the user is thinking of something like raw fish (sushi), but that's more of a Japanese influence. However, Hawaiian cuisine does include some raw fish dishes, but they are part of the culture. So, is that considered gross? Not necessarily. \n\nAnother angle: some dishes in Hawaii might be considered gross by people who are not familiar with them, but that's more about unfamiliarity rather than the food being inherently gross. The term \"gross\" is subjective. For example, a person who doesn't like spicy food might find certain dishes gross, but that's a personal preference, not a cultural standard.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is no. Hawaiian cuisine doesn't embrace foods that are considered gross in the continental US. The dishes that are part of Hawaiian cuisine are either well-accepted or are part of the cultural heritage, even if they are different from continental US foods.

Well, poke is popular in Hawaii and even in other parts of the US, though some people might find raw fish unappealing.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US. First, I need to understand what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. That term is pretty subjective, but maybe they're referring to foods that are seen as unappetizing or unconventional.\n\nHawaiian cuisine is known for dishes like poke, kalua pig, and plate lunches. These are pretty popular and not typically considered gross. However, there might be some local dishes or ingredients that are less common. For example, some traditional Hawaiian foods might use ingredients that are not widely known or might have a strong flavor. But is that considered \"gross\"?\n\nI should also think about cultural context. In Hawaii, certain foods might be part of the local culture and not seen as gross by locals. For instance, raw fish (sashimi) is a staple in Hawaii, but in some parts of the continental US, people might find it gross. However, the question is about whether the cuisine embraces such foods, not whether they're gross in the US. So if the cuisine includes those foods, even if they're gross elsewhere, the answer would be yes.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user is referring to specific dishes that are considered gross in the continental US. Let me think of examples. Maybe some traditional Hawaiian dishes that use unusual ingredients? Or perhaps foods that are not commonly found in the continental US.

It's more about unfamiliarity than grossness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of dishes like spam, which is a processed meat that's popular in Hawaii but might be considered gross by some in the continental US. However, spam is a well-known part of Hawaiian cuisine, so if it's embraced, then the answer would be yes. But is spam considered gross? Some people might find it unappetizing, but others might not. This is getting a bit subjective.\n\nAnother angle: the term \"gross\" might be more about the perception of certain foods. For example, some traditional Hawaiian dishes might use ingredients that are not typically used in continental US cuisine, leading some to find them gross. However, the cuisine of Hawaii includes those ingredients as part of its culture, so the answer would depend on whether those foods are considered gross by the continental US population. But the question is whether the cuisine embraces foods considered gross, not whether the US population finds them gross. So if the cuisine includes those foods, then the answer is yes.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"Does the cuisine of Hawaii embrace foods considered gross in the continental US?\" So it's about whether the cuisine includes foods that are gross in the continental US. So if any of the foods in Hawaiian cuisine are considered gross in the continental US, then the answer would be yes. But I need to verify if there are such foods.\n\nFor example, some Hawaiian dishes might include certain types of seafood, like octopus, which might be considered gross by some. But is that accurate? Or maybe certain types of fish that are not commonly eaten elsewhere. Alternatively, dishes like 'poke' which is raw fish. In some areas, raw fish might be considered gross, but in others, it's common. However, the question is about the continental US as a whole. \n\nI think the key here is that Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are not typically found in continental US cuisine, but that doesn't necessarily make them gross. The term \"gross\" is more about personal preference or cultural aversion. For example, some people might find certain ingredients gross, but others might not. However, the answer would be yes if any of the foods in Hawaiian cuisine are considered gross by some people in the continental US. But the question is phrased as a general yes/no question, so it's likely looking for whether there are such foods. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no, because the cuisine of Hawaii is known for its unique but not gross dishes. But I'm not sure. Maybe there are some exceptions. However, I think the answer is no because Hawaiian cuisine is generally not considered to include foods that are gross in the continental US. The foods are unique but not gross. Therefore, the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US. First, I need to understand what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. Typically, \"gross\" might refer to foods that are slimy, slimy, or have a strong odor, or maybe something that's not commonly eaten there.\n\nHawaiian cuisine is known for dishes like poke, kalua pig, spam, and shave ice. Let me think about each of these. Poke is raw fish, which some people might find unappetizing, but it's a staple there. Kalua pig is slow-cooked, which is different from the usual US pork dishes. Spam is a canned meat product that's popular in Hawaii, but it's not typically considered gross, though some might find it odd. Shave ice is a sweet treat, so that's not gross.\n\nNow, are there any foods in Hawaiian cuisine that are considered gross in the continental US? Maybe some traditional dishes that use ingredients not commonly found in the mainland. For example, some dishes might use fermented foods or certain types of seafood. But I'm not sure if those are considered gross. Alternatively, maybe certain side dishes or condiments. For instance, some Hawaiian dishes might include things like taro or breadfruit, which are not common in the US but aren't necessarily gross.\n\nWait, the term \"gross\" is subjective. What's gross to one person might be normal to another. However, the question is about whether Hawaiian cuisine embraces foods that are considered gross in the continental US. So if there's a food that's part of Hawaiian cuisine but is seen as gross in the mainland, then the answer would be yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nI need to check if any of the traditional Hawaiian foods fall into that category. For example, some dishes might include things like octopus or certain types of shellfish that are not commonly eaten in the US. But again, that's not necessarily gross. Or maybe something like the use of certain spices or cooking methods. Alternatively, maybe the use of certain types of preserved foods.\n\nAnother angle: the term \"gross\" might be used colloquially. For example, in the US, some people might find the use of raw fish (like in poke) gross, but others don't. However, if that's a common perception, then the answer could be yes. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Also, other dishes like spam are a staple in Hawaii, but they're not typically considered gross, even though they're a processed meat.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are some traditional dishes that are considered gross. For example, some Hawaiian dishes might include things like fermented foods or certain types of seafood that are not common. But I'm not certain. I think the answer is no because the traditional Hawaiian foods, while different from continental US cuisine, aren't typically considered gross. They are more about unique ingredients and preparation methods rather than being gross. So the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Hawaiian cuisine embraces foods that are considered gross in the continental US. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. That term is pretty subjective, but maybe things like certain types of fast food, processed foods, or maybe even some traditional dishes that are seen as unhealthy. For example, things like hot dogs, fried foods, or maybe even some fast food chains. But I should check what Hawaiian cuisine actually includes.\n\nHawaiian cuisine is known for dishes like poke, kalua pig, plate lunches (which often include items like fried chicken, spam, rice, and macaroni salad), and shave ice. Some of these, like spam, might be considered gross by some people in the continental US, but they are staples in Hawaiian culture. However, is that the case?\n\nWait, \"gross\" is a bit vague. Maybe the question is referring to foods that are not considered gourmet or are seen as unhealthy. But even then, Hawaiian cuisine has its own traditional foods that are part of the culture. For example, poi, which is made from taro, is a traditional staple. But some people might find it unappetizing due to its texture or taste. However, that's more about personal preference than being considered gross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is pointing to certain foods that are considered unappetizing in the continental US, like certain processed meats or fried items. But in Hawaii, these are part of the local cuisine, especially in plate lunches. So if the question is about whether these foods are embraced despite being considered gross, then the answer might be yes. However, I need to be careful here. Are these foods actually considered gross, or is it just a matter of taste?\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is referencing the stereotype of Hawaii having certain \"gross\" foods, but in reality, the cuisine is more about fresh ingredients and traditional dishes. So maybe the answer is no. But I need to verify.\n\nLooking up some sources, Hawaiian cuisine includes both traditional dishes and some Western influences. Plate lunches, for example, are a blend of Hawaiian and American styles. Spam is a popular item, but it's not necessarily gross to everyone. However, some people might find it unappetizing. But the question is about whether the cuisine \"embrace[s] foods considered gross\" in the continental US. If those foods are considered gross by some, but are part of the cuisine, then the answer would be yes. However, if the foods are not actually considered gross, but just part of the culture, then no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because Hawaiian cuisine is more about fresh, local ingredients, and the \"gross\" foods are not part of it. But I'm not sure. I think the key here is that the answer is likely no. Because the question is a bit of a trick. Hawaiian cuisine is known for its unique dishes, and while some items like spam are part of it, they are not considered gross by the local population. The term \"gross\" is subjective, and the cuisine embraces its own traditional foods, which might not be considered gross in the continental US. So the answer is probably no.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",

      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking whether the cuisine of Hawaii embraces foods that are considered gross in the continental US.

So the question is whether Hawaiian cuisine includes dishes that are seen as gross in the mainland US. \n\nNow, I should think about Hawaiian cuisine. Hawaii has a unique blend of cultures, including Native Hawaiian, Polynesian, and influences from Asian countries like Japan, China, and Korea.

But is that the only example?\n\nOther dishes like pig feet or certain traditional foods might be considered unusual. However, I'm not sure if they're seen as gross. Maybe some people find certain ingredients or preparation methods unappealing, but it's not clear if that's the case. \n\nI should also consider the context of \"gross\" as a cultural preference. What's considered gross in the continental US might not be the same in Hawaii. For example, some foods that are popular in Hawaii might not be as accepted elsewhere. But is the cuisine \"embracing\" those foods? It's more about the cultural acceptance rather than the food being inherently gross. \n\nSo, if spam is considered gross by some, but is embraced in Hawaii, then the answer might be yes. However, if the question is about foods that are universally considered gross, then maybe not. But the question doesn't specify, so I have to make an educated guess. \n\nAnother angle: \"gross\" is subjective. Some people might find certain foods unappetizing, but that's not the same as the cuisine embracing them. So the answer could be yes, because some foods that are considered gross in the continental US are part of Hawaiian cuisine. But I need to check if that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because \"gross\" is not a standard term in culinary contexts. However, the question is asking for a yes/no answer based on whether the cuisine embraces such foods. So if there are examples like spam, then the answer is yes. \n\nI think the correct answer is yes. So the JSON should be {\"decision\": true}.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US. First, I need to think about what's typical in Hawaiian food. I know that Hawaii has a mix of influences, like Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and Native Hawaiian dishes. Common dishes might include things like poke bowls, plate lunches (which often have fried chicken, spam, and rice), kalua pig, and maybe some seafood.\n\nNow, the term \"gross\" is subjective, but I should consider what might be seen as unappetizing in the continental US. For example, some might find certain traditional Hawaiian foods unusual. For instance, dishes like poi (made from taro) or raw fish (like in poke) could be considered strange by some. However, these are staples in Hawaiian cuisine and are not typically labeled as gross by those who are familiar with the culture.\n\nOn the other hand, some foods might be seen as gross due to their preparation or ingredients. For example, the use of spam in plate lunches is a unique aspect of Hawaiian culture, but it's not necessarily gross. It's more about personal taste. Also, certain dishes might have ingredients that are not common in continental US cuisine, but that doesn't make them gross.\n\nI should also consider if there are any specific dishes that are considered gross. Maybe some traditional dishes with strong flavors or unusual textures? But I don't recall any widely recognized Hawaiian dishes that are considered gross. The answer likely depends on the perspective of the person evaluating it. However, since the question is asking if the cuisine embraces such foods, it's more about whether these foods are part of the cuisine, not whether they are universally considered gross.\n\nIn conclusion, while some foods might be considered unusual or unappetizing by some people in the continental US, they are integral to Hawaiian cuisine. Therefore, the answer would be yes, but I need to check if there's a consensus on this. However, given that the question is about embracing such foods, and considering that these dishes are part of the culture, the answer is likely yes. But I should verify if any specific examples are considered gross. Wait, maybe the user is referring to things like raw meat or certain fermented foods? Not sure. But overall, the answer is probably yes, but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no, because the foods that are considered gross are not part of the cuisine. Wait, maybe the answer is no because the cuisine includes foods that are not gross, but the question is whether it embraces foods considered gross. So if there are any such foods, then yes. But I need to think if there are any examples. For example, maybe some traditional dishes with certain ingredients? I think the answer is no, because the foods that are considered gross are not part of the cuisine. Alternatively, maybe some dishes like the use of certain meats or preparation methods. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is no, but I need to be careful. I think the correct answer is no, because Hawaiian cuisine is known for its unique dishes that are not typically considered gross. However, some might find certain aspects gross, but the cuisine as a whole doesn't embrace foods that are universally considered gross. So the answer is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US. First, I need to understand what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. Typically, \"gross\" might refer to foods that are seen as unappetizing, revolting, or unconventional. \n\nNow, thinking about Hawaiian cuisine, it's a mix of various influences like Polynesian, Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian flavors. Dishes like poke bowls, kalua pig, and shave ice are popular. But are there any dishes that might be considered gross? Maybe some raw foods or certain ingredients?\n\nWait, poke is raw fish, which might be seen as gross by some people in the continental US. However, it's a staple in Hawaii and widely accepted there. Another example could be the use of certain local ingredients like taro or breadfruit, but those aren't typically considered gross. \n\nAlso, some dishes might have strong flavors or unusual presentations. For instance, spam is a common ingredient in Hawaii, but it's not usually considered gross. However, there's a dish called \"Loco Moco\" which is a rice cake with a meat patty, egg, and gravy. That's more of a comfort food and not gross. \n\nI should also consider cultural context. What's considered gross is subjective and varies by region and individual preferences. In Hawaii, many of these foods are part of the local culture and are appreciated. So even if some people in the continental US find certain foods gross, they are embraced in Hawaii. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be yes, because some foods that might be seen as gross in the continental US are embraced in Hawaiian cuisine. But wait, I need to make sure that these foods are actually part of Hawaiian cuisine. For example, raw fish (sushi) is part of Japanese cuisine, which is present in Hawaii, but is it considered gross there? Probably not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some dishes that are traditional in Hawaii but not common elsewhere. For instance, certain types of fermented foods or specific preparation methods. However, I'm not sure if those are considered gross. \n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some foods that are unconventional, the overall answer would depend on whether those specific foods are considered gross. Since the question is a yes/no, and there are examples like raw fish (poke) which might be seen as gross by some, but are part of Hawaiian cuisine, the answer would be yes. But I need to verify if \"gross\" is the right term here. Maybe the question is using \"gross\" in a more colloquial sense, like weird or unusual. In that case, Hawaiian cuisine does have unique dishes that might be considered unusual in the continental US. So the answer would be yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US. First, I need to understand what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. Typically, \"gross\" might refer to foods that are seen as unappetizing, slimy, or with strong odors. \n\nNow, thinking about Hawaiian cuisine, it's a mix of native Hawaiian ingredients and influences from other cultures, like Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and more. Common dishes include things like poke bowls, kalua pig, shave ice, and tropical fruits. These are generally seen as healthy and delicious.\n\nWait, but there are some traditional dishes that might be considered unusual. For example, poi, made from taro root, has a distinct texture and taste. Some people might find it unappealing. But is that considered \"gross\"? Maybe in some contexts, but it's a staple in Hawaiian culture. \n\nAnother example could be foods like fermented foods, which are common in some parts of the world but might be considered strange in the US. However, Hawaiian cuisine doesn't have a lot of fermented foods. \n\nAlso, there's the concept of \"local\" or \"traditional\" foods. Some dishes might be seen as gross by outsiders but are cherished by locals. For instance, raw fish (sashimi) is part of Hawaiian cuisine but might be considered gross by some. However, the question is about the cuisine embracing such foods. \n\nBut I should check if there are specific dishes in Hawaiian cuisine that are considered gross in the continental US. Maybe something like 'inamona' (a type of bread made from taro) or 'lomi lomi salmon' which is a raw salmon dish. However, these are part of the cuisine and are not typically considered gross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some dishes that are considered \"gross\" in the US, like certain types of seafood or specific cooking methods. For example, 'kalua pig' is slow-roasted, which is a traditional method but not gross. \n\nI think the answer is that Hawaiian cuisine does not primarily embrace foods that are considered gross in the continental US. The foods that are traditional are more about unique ingredients and preparation methods rather than being gross. So the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US. First, I need to understand what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. Typically, \"gross\" might refer to foods that are slimy, slimy, or have strong odors, like certain types of seafood or organs. \n\nHawaiian cuisine is known for dishes like poke, kalua pig, and spam. Let me think about each. Poke is raw fish, which some people might find unappetizing, but it's a staple there. Kalua pig is slow-cooked and often marinated, which is more about flavor than being gross. Spam is a processed meat that's popular in Hawaii, but again, it's a matter of taste. \n\nNow, considering the continental US, some might find raw fish or processed meats like spam unappealing. However, these are traditional and culturally significant in Hawaii. So, the answer depends on whether these foods are considered gross by the general continental US population. But I need to be careful here. The question is about embracing foods that are considered gross, not whether they are gross in general. \n\nHawaiian cuisine does include some foods that might be seen as unusual or not to everyone's taste, but does that make them \"gross\"? Maybe the answer is yes, because some of the ingredients or preparation methods are different and might be considered unappetizing by some. However, it's important to note that cultural context plays a role. The question is about the cuisine embracing such foods, not whether they are gross in general. So, if the foods are considered gross in the continental US, then the answer would be yes. But if the term \"gross\" is subjective, then maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to specific foods. For example, some dishes might include things like insects or certain organs, but I don't think that's part of Hawaiian cuisine. So, the answer might be no. Wait, but some people might find the raw fish in poke gross. But in Hawaii, it's a delicacy. So, the cuisine does include foods that some people might find unappetizing, but does that mean they are considered gross in the continental US? It's possible that the answer is yes, but I need to verify. \n\nI think the answer is yes. For example, poke is raw fish, which some people might find gross, but it's a key part of Hawaiian cuisine. So the cuisine does embrace foods that some might consider gross. Therefore, the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that are considered gross in the continental US. First, I need to understand what's considered \"gross\" in the continental US. That term is pretty subjective, but maybe they're referring to foods that are unconventional, spicy, or have strong flavors. \n\nHawaiian cuisine is known for dishes like poke, kalua pig, and plate lunches. Let me think about these. Poke is raw fish, which might be seen as gross by some people in the continental US, especially those not used to raw seafood. Kalua pig is slow-roasted, which is a traditional dish, but maybe some people find the texture or the way it's prepared unusual. Plate lunches often include things like spam, which is a processed meat that's pretty common in Hawaii but might be considered gross by others. \n\nHowever, the term \"gross\" is quite vague. It's possible that the user is referring to foods that are considered unappetizing or have strong odors. For example, some traditional Hawaiian dishes might have ingredients that are not common in the continental US. But I need to check if these are actually considered gross. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the user is thinking of certain dishes that are more about flavor than appearance. For instance, some dishes might have strong spices or textures that some people find unappealing. But I should also consider cultural context. In Hawaii, these foods are part of the local culture and are enjoyed by many. \n\nI should also think about whether there's any evidence that these foods are considered gross in the continental US. For example, spam is a staple in Hawaii but is often viewed as a processed food, which some might find unappealing. However, not everyone would find it gross. Similarly, raw fish is a common dish in Japan and other places, so maybe it's not as gross in those contexts. \n\nBut the question is about the continental US. So, if some people in the continental US find these foods gross, does that count? The question is phrased as \"embrace foods considered gross,\" so it's about whether Hawaiian cuisine includes such foods, not necessarily that they are universally considered gross. \n\nSo, if Hawaiian cuisine includes foods that some people in the continental US might find gross, then the answer would be yes. But if those foods are not considered gross by the majority, then no. \n\nI think the answer is yes. For example, poke is raw fish, which some people might find gross. Spam is a processed meat that's not common in the continental US. Kalua pig is a traditional dish, but the preparation method (slow-roasted in an underground oven) might be unfamiliar. So, there are elements of Hawaiian cuisine that could be considered gross by some people in the continental US. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}"
