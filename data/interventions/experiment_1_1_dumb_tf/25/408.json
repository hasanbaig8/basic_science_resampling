      "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether surfing was popular when pogs came out. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out when pogs became popular. Pogs, also known as \"POGO\" or \"pocket o' gold,\" are those small, shiny discs that were a fad in the mid-90s. I think they were especially popular around 1995 to 1996. They were a big part of the toy culture during that time, and there were even competitions and a TV show called \"Pogo\" that aired in the late 90s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity timeline. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity in the mainstream, especially in the US, peaked in the 1960s with the rise of surf culture, movies like \"Blue Hawaii,\" and the influence of surfers like Duke Kahanamoku. However, surfing's popularity has had ups and downs. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest, partly due to the success of professional surfers like Kelly Slater, who won multiple world championships in the 90s. But was surfing as mainstream as pogs during the mid-90s?\n\nSo, pogs were a fad that was very popular around 1995-1996. Surfing, while still a popular sport and culture, wasn't as widely mainstream as pogs. However, the question is about whether surfing was popular when pogs came out. Since the 90s saw both surfing and pogs being popular, but pogs were more of a fad, and surfing was already a established culture. But maybe the question is more about whether surfing was popular during the same time as pogs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because pogs were a fad, and surfing was a more established activity. But I need to check if there's any overlap in their popularity. For example, if pogs came out in the mid-90s, and surfing was already popular, then the answer would be yes. But if the question is about whether surfing was as popular as pogs, then maybe not. The question is phrased as \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So the answer would be yes, because surfing was already a popular activity, even if it wasn't as mainstream as pogs. Or maybe the answer is no because pogs were a fad and surfing was more established. Wait, the question isn't comparing their popularity, just asking if surfing was popular during the time pogs came out. So since surfing has always been popular, even if it wasn't as trendy as pogs, the answer would be yes. But I need to verify the exact timeline. \n\nWait, pogs came out in the mid-90s, so around 1995. Surfing in the 90s was still popular, especially with the rise of professional surfing. So the answer would be yes. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is no because during the time pogs were a fad, surfing wasn't as popular. But that's not accurate. Surfing was definitely popular in the 90s. So the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, first, I need to figure out when pogs came out. Pogs, also known as \"poogs\" or \"pog chips,\" were a fad in the 1990s. They were those little plastic discs that people collected and played with. The peak of their popularity was around the mid-90s, maybe 1995 to 1996. \n\nNow, surfing's popularity... Well, surfing has been around since the early 20th century, but its popularity has fluctuated. In the 90s, there was a resurgence in surfing culture, especially with the rise of professional surfing competitions and the influence of surfers in mainstream media. However, the 90s also saw the emergence of other trends, like skateboarding and extreme sports, which might have competed for attention.\n\nWait, but when pogs came out, was surfing already a popular activity? Let me think. The 1990s were a time when surfing was definitely in the public eye. For example, the 1990s saw the dominance of surfers like Kelly Slater, who became a global icon. There were also many surf movies and documentaries during that time. So surfing was definitely popular in the 90s. \n\nBut the question is specifically about when pogs came out. If pogs became popular around the mid-90s, then surfing was already a well-established activity. However, was surfing's popularity at its peak during the same time as pogs? Or was surfing's popularity earlier? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about whether surfing was popular during the time when pogs were popular. Since pogs were a fad, their peak was in the mid-90s. If surfing was already a popular activity, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the user is asking if surfing was popular at the exact time pogs were introduced. \n\nWait, when exactly did pogs come out? The pogs were introduced in the early 90s, but became a big hit around 1995. So during that time, surfing was already a popular sport. Therefore, the answer would be yes, surfing was popular when pogs came out. \n\nBut I should check if there's any conflicting information. For example, maybe during the time pogs were popular, surfing's popularity dipped. However, I don't recall that being the case. Surfers were still in the spotlight, and the 90s were a golden era for surfing. So I think the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if surfing was popular when pogs came out. Let me start by recalling what pogs are. Pogs are those plastic discs that were a big fad in the mid-90s, right? They were like collectible toys, and people would play games with them. The peak of their popularity was around 1995-1996.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity... Well, surfing has been around for a long time, but its mainstream popularity in the US has had different peaks. The 1960s and 1970s were big for surfing, with surf culture becoming a significant part of youth culture. Then there was the 1990s with the rise of professional surfing and events like the World Championship Tour. But was surfing as popular in the mid-90s as pogs were?\n\nWait, pogs were a fad that was very popular among kids and teens, especially in the early to mid-90s. Surfing, on the other hand, had a more established presence in the culture, but maybe not as widespread as pogs. However, the question is about whether surfing was popular when pogs came out, not necessarily if they were the most popular thing. \n\nBut I should check the timeline. When did pogs start? They were introduced in the late 80s and became popular in the mid-90s. So during that time, surfing was still a part of popular culture, but was it as popular as pogs? Maybe not. But the question is about whether surfing was popular, not necessarily if it was the most popular. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a connection. Surfing was popular in the 90s, but pogs were a different kind of trend. So the answer would be yes, surfing was popular when pogs came out, but not necessarily the most popular thing. However, if the question is asking if surfing was popular at that time, then the answer is yes. But I need to make sure. \n\nWait, another angle: when pogs became popular, were there any major surfing events or cultural moments? For example, the 1990s saw the rise of professional surfers like Kelly Slater, who became a global icon. So surfing was definitely a significant part of the culture, even if it wasn't the same as pogs. So the answer would be yes, surfing was popular when pogs came out. Therefore, the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, I need to determine if surfing was popular during the time when pogs became popular.\n\nFirst, I should figure out when pogs came out. From what I remember, pogs are those plastic discs that were a big fad in the 90s. They became really popular around the mid-90s, maybe late 90s. I think they were especially popular in the early to mid-90s, like the 1990s. So the timeframe here is the 90s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity has fluctuated. In the 90s, surfing was definitely a part of mainstream culture. There were famous surfers like Kelly Slater, who was a big name in the 90s. The 90s saw the rise of professional surfing competitions, and surfing was featured in movies and media. So surfing was pretty popular during the 90s.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there was a specific period when pogs were at their peak. Pogs became a huge fad in the mid-90s, maybe around 1994-1995. So during that time, surfing was still a popular activity. However, I need to be careful. Was there a period when surfing's popularity dipped? For example, maybe in the late 90s, but I don't think so. Surfing continued to be popular throughout the 90s, even as pogs were a fad.\n\nAnother angle: were there any cultural overlaps? Pogs were a kids' toy, while surfing was a sport. They might not have been directly related, but both were popular in the same era. So if pogs were popular in the 90s, then surfing was also popular during that time. Therefore, the answer would be yes.\n\nBut I need to make sure there's no conflicting information. Maybe some sources say that surfing wasn't as popular in the 90s? Wait, no. The 90s were a golden age for surfing. The sport grew significantly, with more competitions, sponsorships, and media coverage. So surfing was definitely popular when pogs came out. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",

Pogs are those little plastic discs that were a big fad in the mid-90s, right? They were like collectible items, and kids would play with them. Now, when did pogs come out? I think the peak of the pog craze was around the mid-90s, maybe 1995-1996. \n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its mainstream popularity in the US has had ups and downs. The 1950s and 1960s were big for surfing, with surf culture becoming a big part of the youth movement. Then in the 70s and 80s, it was still popular, but maybe not as much as the earlier decades. The 90s... I'm not sure. I think surfing was still around but maybe not as mainstream as it was before. \n\nWait, but when pogs came out in the mid-90s, was surfing still popular? Let me think. There were some surf movies around that time, like \"Blue Crush\" in 2002, but that's later. Maybe in the mid-90s, surfing was still a niche activity but not as mainstream as the 60s or 70s. However, the question isn't about whether surfing was the most popular thing, but whether it was popular at all during the time pogs were out. \n\nSo, if pogs were a big deal in the mid-90s, and surfing was still a thing, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the question is implying whether surfing was as popular as pogs? But the question is just asking if surfing was popular when pogs came out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a connection between the two. Like, were they both popular at the same time? If pogs were a fad in the mid-90s, and surfing was still a cultural thing, then the answer would be yes. But if surfing had declined significantly by then, then no. \n\nI think surfing was still popular in the 90s, but maybe not as much as in the previous decades.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, first, I need to figure out when pogs came out. Pogs, also known as \"POGS\" or \"Pog Chips,\" were a type of collectible toy that became popular in the mid-1990s. They were small, round discs made of plastic, and they were a big hit among kids and collectors around that time.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity has fluctuated over the years. Surfing has always had a cult following, especially in coastal areas, but its mainstream popularity has varied. The 1990s saw some big names in surfing, like Kelly Slater, who became a major figure. However, surfing wasn't as mainstream as other activities during that period. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the time when pogs came out. If pogs were popular in the mid-90s, then we need to check if surfing was popular around that same time. Let me think. The 90s had some major surfing events and athletes, but surfing wasn't as widely mainstream as, say, skateboarding or other trends. However, it's possible that surfing had a certain level of popularity, but maybe not as high as pogs. \n\nWait, but the question isn't asking if surfing was as popular as pogs, just if it was popular when pogs came out. So even if surfing wasn't the most popular activity, it might still have been popular enough. But I need to be careful here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a connection between the two. For example, if pogs were a fad that came out in the mid-90s, and surfing was a sport that was already established. But the question is whether surfing was popular during that time. \n\nI think the answer is that surfing was not as popular as pogs, but that doesn't mean it wasn't popular. However, the question is asking if surfing was popular when pogs came out. So if pogs were around in the mid-90s, and surfing had a certain level of popularity, then the answer might be yes. But I need to verify the timeline. \n\nWait, pogs were popular in the mid-90s, like around 1990s. Surfing had its heyday in the 60s and 70s with the beach culture, but in the 90s, it was still a sport with some mainstream presence. So maybe the answer is yes. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because surfing wasn't as popular during the time pogs were a big hit. But I need to check. Let me think again. \n\nSurfing was definitely popular in the 90s, especially with the rise of professional surfing and events like the World Championships. However, compared to the fad of pogs, which were a toy that was more of a cultural phenomenon, maybe surfing wasn't as mainstream. But the question is about popularity in general, not necessarily compared to pogs. \n\nSo, the answer would be yes, surfing was popular when pogs came out, but I'm not 100% certain. Wait, but I think the answer is that surfing was not as popular as pogs, but the question isn't comparing them. It's just asking if surfing was popular during the time pogs were out. So if pogs came out in the mid-90s, and surfing was a sport that had a following, then the answer would be yes. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let me think of other factors. For example, the 90s saw a lot of surfing in media, like the movie \"Blue Crush\" (2000), but that's later. So maybe during the time pogs were popular (mid-90s), surfing was still a popular sport, even if not as mainstream as other things. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" I need to answer yes or no. First, I should figure out when pogs came out. Pogs, also known as \"Pogs\" or \"Pogo,\" are those small, disc-shaped toys that were popular in the mid-90s. I think they became a big fad around 1995 or 1996. \n\nNow, surfing's popularity over time. Surfing has been around since the early 20th century, but its mainstream popularity has had ups and downs. In the 1950s and 1960s, surfing was really big in the US, especially with the rise of surf culture and the influence of surf movies. However, by the 1970s and 1980s, it started to decline in mainstream popularity, though it remained a niche sport. \n\nThe 1990s saw a resurgence of surfing, partly due to the popularity of professional surfers like Kelly Slater, who became a global icon. But when pogs came out in the mid-90s, was surfing already on the rise again? Let me think. If pogs were a big deal in 1995-1996, then during that time, surfing might have been gaining some traction again. However, I'm not sure if surfing was as mainstream as it was in the 60s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about whether surfing was popular in the same way as pogs. Since pogs were a toy craze, and surfing is a sport, their popularity might not be directly comparable. But the question is about whether surfing was popular when pogs came out, not necessarily if they were both popular. \n\nSo, if pogs came out in the mid-90s, and surfing was experiencing a resurgence during that time, then the answer might be yes. But I should check if surfing was indeed popular during that period. For example, the 1990s saw the growth of professional surfing, with events like the World Surf League, and the sport became more mainstream. So, maybe surfing was popular enough that when pogs came out, it was already in a phase of renewed popularity. \n\nHowever, I need to be careful. If the question is about the same level of popularity as pogs, then maybe not. But the question isn't asking if they were equally popular, just if surfing was popular when pogs came out. So if surfing was in a period of growth or continued popularity, the answer would be yes. \n\nI think the answer is yes. Surfing was popular when pogs came out in the mid-90s.

So the timeframe here is probably the mid-90s, maybe 1990s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity in mainstream culture has had peaks and valleys. In the 90s, there was a resurgence of surfing's popularity, especially with the rise of professional surfers like Kelly Slater. The 90s were a big time for surfing, with events like the World Surf League gaining more attention. Also, movies like \"Blue Crush\" came out in 2002, but that's a bit later. So maybe the late 90s to early 2000s were a peak for surfing.\n\nBut when did pogs come out? Pogs started in the late 80s, but they became a major fad in the mid-90s. So the peak of pogs was around 1995-1996. So during that time, surfing was already popular. The 90s were a time when surfing was gaining more mainstream attention. So it's likely that surfing was popular when pogs came out. \n\nBut wait, was surfing as popular as it was in the 90s when pogs were at their peak? Let me check. The 90s saw the rise of surfing in popular culture, with more media coverage, surf brands, and events. So yes, surfing was definitely popular during the time pogs were a big deal.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, first, I need to figure out when pogs came out. Pogs, also known as \"pocket change\" or \"pog games,\" were a trend in the mid-90s. I remember they were those small, round discs that people would collect and play with. The exact release date might be around 1995 or 1996. \n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity in the mainstream, especially in the US, had some peaks. The 1960s and 1970s were big for surfing culture, with icons like Duke Kahanamoku and the rise of surfboard manufacturing. However, by the 1990s, surfing was still around but maybe not as mainstream as it was before. But there were still surfer communities and events.\n\nWait, but the question is about when pogs came out. If pogs were in the mid-90s, was surfing still popular during that time? Let me think. The 1990s saw the rise of professional surfing, with events like the World Surf League. There were also surfer celebrities like Kelly Slater, who started gaining fame in the late 80s and continued into the 90s. So surfing was still a thing. But was it as popular as it was in the 60s or 70s? Maybe not, but it wasn't entirely unpopular.\n\nHowever, the question is whether surfing was popular when pogs came out. If pogs came out in the mid-90s, then during that time, surfing was still a part of pop culture, though perhaps not as dominant as in earlier decades. But maybe the answer is yes because surfing was still around and had a following. Alternatively, maybe the question is implying that when pogs came out, surfing was not as popular. But I need to check if there's a specific time frame.\n\nWait, I should verify the exact years. Pogs were popular in the mid-90s, specifically around 1995-1996. During that time, surfing was still a part of the culture, but perhaps not as mainstream as it was in the 60s. However, the answer might depend on whether \"popular\" refers to mainstream popularity or just having a presence. If the question is about mainstream popularity, maybe the answer is no. But if it's about being present in culture, then yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a specific event or data point. For example, during the 90s, the popularity of surfing might have declined compared to the 60s and 70s, but it wasn't gone. So when pogs came out, surfing was still a thing, but maybe not as popular as before. Therefore, the answer could be yes, because it was still popular in some circles, but not necessarily as much as in previous decades. However, the question is a simple yes/no, so I need to decide based on general knowledge.\n\nAnother angle: Pogs were a fad, and the 90s had many fads. Surfing was still a part of the culture, so maybe it was considered popular. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is false because surfing wasn't as popular as it was in the 60s, but it was still popular enough. Alternatively, the answer might be yes because it was still a part of the culture.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there's any historical data. For example, the 1990s saw the rise of professional surfing, with Kelly Slater winning multiple world titles. So surfing was definitely present and popular in the 90s, even if not as much as in the 60s. Therefore, when pogs came out in the mid-90s, surfing was still popular. So the answer would be yes.

      "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if surfing was popular when pogs came out. First, I need to figure out when pogs were popular. Pogs, also known as \"POGs\" or \"Pog Chips,\" were a type of collectible toy that became a big craze in the mid-1990s. They were small, round, colored chips that people collected and traded. The peak of their popularity was around 1995 to 1996, especially in the United States.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity timeline. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its mainstream popularity in the US has had different peaks. The 1960s and 1970s were big for surfing, with figures like Gerry Lopez and the rise of surf culture. However, by the 1990s, surfing was still popular, especially with the growth of professional surfing competitions and the influence of surf brands. But was it as popular as during the 60s and 70s?\n\nSo, when pogs came out in the mid-90s, surfing was still a popular activity, but maybe not as much as it was in the previous decades. However, the question isn't about comparing popularity levels but whether surfing was popular at that time. Since surfing had a significant presence in the 90s, even if it wasn't the peak, it was still popular. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I need to make sure there's no overlap or specific events. Alternatively, maybe the question is more about whether surfing was as popular as pogs were.

Wait, maybe I should check if there were any major surfing events or cultural impact in the mid-90s. For example, the 1990s saw the rise of professional surfing competitions and some surfers becoming celebrities. So perhaps surfing was still popular, but not as much as in the 60s. But the question is whether it was popular when pogs came out. If pogs were a big part of the 90s, then maybe surfing was still popular. But I'm not sure.

Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity in the mainstream, especially in the US, had some ups and downs. The 1950s and 1960s were big for surfing, with the Beach Boys and the cultural impact of the sport. But by the 1990s, there was a decline in mainstream popularity. However, there were still some surfer culture and maybe some resurgence in certain areas. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the time when pogs came out. If pogs were popular in the mid-90s, then we need to check if surfing was popular during that time. Let me think. The 90s saw some surfers like Kelly Slater becoming prominent, but maybe the general public's interest in surfing wasn't as high as in the 60s. However, there were events like the World Surf League, which might have kept it in the public eye. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about whether surfing was a mainstream popular activity during the same period as pogs. If pogs were a fad, maybe the answer is no, because surfing wasn't as mainstream. But I'm not sure. Maybe there's a connection between the two? For example, did pogs come out during a time when surfing was still popular? \n\nWait, I should check the exact timeline. Pogs became popular in the mid-90s, around 1990s. Surfing's peak was earlier. By the 90s, maybe it was not as popular. So the answer might be no. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe there's some overlap. However, since the user is asking for a yes/no answer, I need to make a judgment based on available knowledge. \n\nAnother angle: The popularity of pogs was a fad, which suggests that they were a temporary trend. If surfing was not a major trend at that time, then the answer would be no. But I'm not sure if surfing was considered popular or not. Maybe it was still a niche activity. \n\nI think the answer is no. Because the 90s saw a decline in surfing's mainstream popularity compared to earlier decades, so when pogs came out, surfing wasn't as popular. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, first, I need to figure out when pogs became popular and then check the popularity of surfing around that time.\n\nI remember that pogs, also known as \"poogs\" or \"pocket gods,\" were a fad in the mid-90s. They were those small, round discs that people collected and played games with. The peak of their popularity was around 1995 to 1996. So, the time frame here is the mid-90s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity in the mainstream culture might have varied. The 1990s saw some big names in surfing, like Kelly Slater, who became a dominant force in the sport. However, the 90s also had some major surfing events and media exposure, which might have kept surfing in the public eye. But was it as popular as the pogs fad?\n\nWait, but the question isn't about whether surfing was as popular as pogs, but whether it was popular when pogs came out. So even if surfing wasn't the most popular thing at that time, if it was still a known or active sport, the answer would be yes. However, if surfing was not popular at all during that period, then the answer would be no.\n\nI should check the timeline. Pogs became popular in the mid-90s. Surfing, as a sport, had been around for decades. Even if it wasn't the most mainstream, it was still a recognized activity. For example, the 1990s saw the rise of professional surfing and the World Surf League. So, even if the pogs were a fad, surfing was still popular in its own right. Therefore, the answer would be yes, surfing was popular when pogs came out. But wait, maybe the question is implying whether surfing was as popular as pogs? But the question doesn't say that. It just asks if surfing was popular when pogs came out. So if surfing was still a known and active sport during that time, then yes. So the answer is yes.

They were those little plastic discs that people collected, and they became really popular around the mid to late 90s. So the time frame here is probably the mid-90s, maybe 1990s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity in mainstream culture has had peaks and valleys. In the 1960s, surfing was really big, thanks to movies like \"Blue Hawaii\" and the Beach Boys. Then, in the 1970s and 80s, it remained a cultural icon, especially with surfers like Gerry Lopez and the rise of surf culture in Hawaii. But by the 1990s, surfing's mainstream popularity might have started to decline, especially with the rise of other trends like skateboarding and hip-hop. However, there were still surfer celebrities and some continued interest.\n\nWait, but the question is about when pogs came out. If pogs were popular in the mid-90s, say around 1994-1996, then I need to check if surfing was popular during that time. Let me think. The 90s saw some big surf events and athletes, but maybe not the same level as the 60s or 70s. Also, the 90s had more mainstream media coverage of surfing, but perhaps not as much as before. However, there's also the possibility that surfing was still popular enough to be part of the culture, even if not as dominant as in previous decades.\n\nAnother angle: the 90s had a lot of surf movies and documentaries, like \"Blue Crush\" in 2002, but that's later. Maybe in the mid-90s, there was still a presence. But maybe the answer is that surfing wasn't as popular as it was in the 60s or 70s during the time pogs were popular. But the question isn't about whether it was as popular as before, just whether it was popular at all. So if surfing was still a recognized and popular activity during the 90s when pogs were around, the answer would be yes. But if it was not popular, then no.\n\nI think surfing was still popular enough in the 90s, even if not as much as in the 60s or 70s. So the answer would be yes. Wait, but maybe the question is more about the mainstream popularity. For example, if pogs were a fad, maybe the answer is that surfing wasn't as popular during that time. But I'm not sure. Let me check some facts. \n\nPogs became popular in the mid-90s, around 1994-1996. Surfing's mainstream popularity was waning in the 90s. However, it's still a significant culture in certain regions and among specific groups. So maybe the answer is that it wasn't as popular as it was in the 60s, but was still popular enough. However, the question is whether it was popular when pogs came out. So if surfing was still a popular activity during the time pogs were a fad, the answer would be yes.

They were those little plastic discs that people collected, and there was a big craze around them, especially in the early to mid-90s. So the peak popularity of pogs was probably around 1994-1995.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its mainstream popularity in the US had a big boost in the 1960s with the Beach Boys and the counterculture movement. However, there were also periods of decline and resurgence. In the 1990s, surfing was still a part of popular culture, but maybe not as mainstream as it was in the 60s or 70s. But I need to check if there was a specific period when surfing was particularly popular around the same time as pogs.\n\nWait, the 1990s saw the rise of professional surfing, with athletes like Kelly Slater becoming famous. So maybe surfing was still popular in the 90s. But was it as popular as during the 60s or 70s? Also, the question is about whether surfing was popular when pogs came out, not necessarily the same level of popularity. So if pogs were a big fad in the mid-90s, and surfing was still a known and practiced activity, then the answer might be yes. But I should check if there was any significant decline in surfing's popularity during that time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about whether surfing was considered a mainstream or widely popular activity when pogs were at their peak. If surfing was still popular in the 90s, then the answer would be yes. However, if surfing's popularity had waned significantly by then, then it would be no. \n\nAnother angle: the term \"popular\" could mean different things. If surfing was still practiced and recognized, even if not as mainstream as before, then it could be considered popular. But if the question is about being a mainstream cultural phenomenon, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is yes. Surfing was still a popular activity in the 90s when pogs were around.

Pogs are those small, round discs that were a fad in the mid-90s. They were popular around 1995 to 1997, I think. So the timeframe here is late 90s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its mainstream popularity has had peaks and valleys. The 1960s and 1970s were big for surfing, with the Beach Boys and the rise of surf culture. Then in the 80s and 90s, there were still surfers, but maybe not as much as before. However, the late 90s might have seen some resurgence with events like the World Surf League and maybe some media attention. \n\nBut wait, when pogs came out, was surfing already in decline? The 90s might have been a time when surfing was still popular but not as much as in the previous decades. However, there were also some notable surfers like Kelly Slater, who started gaining fame in the late 80s and continued into the 90s. \n\nAnother angle: Did surfing and pogs coexist in popularity? Since pogs were a fad, maybe they didn't directly impact surfing's popularity. But the question is about whether surfing was popular during the time pogs were around. So if pogs were a mid-90s fad, and surfing was still a known activity, even if not as mainstream as before, then the answer might be yes. But if surfing had declined significantly by then, maybe not. \n\nI should check some historical data. Surfing's popularity in the 90s: The 90s saw the rise of professional surfing, with events like the World Championship Tour. Kelly Slater won multiple titles in the 90s. So there was definitely a presence in the sports world. However, compared to the 60s and 70s, maybe it wasn't as culturally dominant. But the question is about popularity, not necessarily cultural dominance. \n\nPogs were a toy, so they were popular among kids. Surfing's popularity might have been more among adults or specific communities. So even if surfing wasn't as mainstream as before, it was still popular in certain circles. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely yes. Surfing was still popular during the time pogs were out.

Pogs are those small, disc-shaped toys that were popular in the 90s. I think they became a big fad around the mid to late 90s. So the timeframe is probably 1990s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its mainstream popularity has had peaks and valleys. In the 90s, there was a resurgence of interest in surfing, partly due to the influence of professional surfers like Kelly Slater. The 90s saw the rise of surfing as a sport and a cultural phenomenon, with more media coverage and events. However, surfing's popularity might have been more about the culture and the sport itself rather than the toy pogs.\n\nBut the question is whether surfing was popular when pogs came out. Since pogs were a toy, maybe the question is about whether surfing was a popular activity at the same time as pogs were a fad. If pogs were a big part of the 90s culture, and surfing was also popular during that time, then the answer might be yes. However, I need to check if there's any direct link or if they were concurrent but not necessarily related.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that pogs were a toy, and surfing is a sport. So even if they were both popular in the same era, the question is about whether surfing was popular when pogs were released. If pogs came out in the mid-90s, and surfing was already popular before that, then the answer would be yes. But if pogs came out later, maybe in the late 90s, and surfing was declining, then maybe not. But I think surfing was still popular in the 90s. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe the question is trying to trick me. Like, if pogs were a fad, maybe the answer is no because surfing wasn't as popular as pogs, but that's not the question. The question is whether surfing was popular when pogs came out, not comparing their popularity. \n\nI think the answer is yes. Both were popular in the 90s. Surfing was part of the cultural scene, and pogs were a toy fad. So the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, first, I need to figure out the time periods for both surfing's popularity and when pogs were around.\n\nPogs, also known as \"pocket change\" or \"pog chips,\" became a big fad in the early 1990s. They were those small, colorful discs that kids collected, and they were really popular around 1993-1994. So the key here is to check if surfing was popular during that time.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity has had several peaks. The 1950s and 1960s were big for surfing, especially with the rise of surf culture in Hawaii and the surfing boom in the US. Then there was a decline in the 70s and 80s, but it started to make a comeback in the 1990s with the growth of professional surfing and events like the World Surf League. However, the 1990s also saw the rise of other activities and media, so maybe surfing wasn't as mainstream as it was in the earlier decades.\n\nBut wait, the question is about when pogs came out, which was the early 90s. So during that time, was surfing still popular? Let me think. The 1990s did see a resurgence in surfing, especially with the popularity of surf movies and the success of surfers like Kelly Slater. However, the 90s also had other cultural trends, so it's possible that surfing wasn't as widespread as in the 60s. But was it still considered popular? Maybe not as much as the 60s, but perhaps there was a growing interest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that surfing wasn't as popular as it was in the 60s, but the question is whether it was popular at all during the time pogs came out. If the 90s had some level of popularity, even if not as high as before, then the answer could be yes. However, if the question is asking if it was as popular as during the peak times, then the answer might be no. But the question is just asking if it was popular when pogs came out, not necessarily as popular as before.\n\nAnother angle: Pogs were a fad, so maybe the question is more about whether surfing was a mainstream activity during that time. If the 90s saw a revival, then yes. But if the 90s were a time when surfing was less popular compared to earlier decades, then the answer might be no. I need to check some historical context.\n\nLooking up, the 1990s did see a revival of surfing, with more media coverage and the growth of professional surfing. However, the peak popularity might still be in the 60s. So during the time pogs came out (early 90s), surfing was not as popular as in the 60s, but it was still a popular sport. Therefore, the answer would be yes, surfing was popular when pogs came out, but not as much as in the past. However, the question is a yes/no, so maybe the answer is yes. Alternatively, if the answer depends on the definition of \"popular,\" maybe it's considered popular enough. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is no because surfing wasn't as mainstream as other trends during the 90s. Wait, but the 90s had other trends too. I'm a bit confused. Maybe the answer is yes, because there was a resurgence, so it was popular. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no. Let me think again. If pogs were a big fad in the early 90s, and surfing was still a known sport, then it's possible that it was considered popular. So the answer might be yes. But I need to be accurate. Maybe the answer is no because surfing wasn't as popular as it was in the 60s, but the question is whether it was popular when pogs came out. If it was still a popular activity, then yes. I think the answer is yes, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no. Wait, I should check some sources. For example, in the 90s, surfing was definitely more popular than in the 70s and 80s, but not as much as the 60s.

They were those small, round, colored plastic discs that people collected. The peak of their popularity was around 1995-1996. So the key here is to determine the timeline of surfing's popularity relative to that period.\n\nNow, surfing has been around for a long time, dating back to ancient times, but in terms of modern popularity, it became a significant cultural phenomenon in the 1950s and 1960s with the rise of surf culture in places like Hawaii and California. The 1960s and 1970s saw surfing gain a lot of mainstream attention, especially with the influence of surf movies and the surfing community. However, by the 1990s, surfing had already been a well-established sport and culture. \n\nBut wait, the question is about when pogs came out, which was the mid-90s. So during that time, was surfing still popular? Well, surfing remained popular as a sport and a cultural activity.

The 1960s and 1970s were big for surfing, with the rise of surf culture and famous surfers like Gerry Lopez and Jim Morrison. However, by the mid-90s, surfing was still a part of popular culture, but maybe not as mainstream as it was in the previous decades. However, the 1990s saw the rise of professional surfing competitions, like the World Championship Tour, which brought more attention to the sport.

Since pogs were popular in the mid-90s, and surfing was still a significant part of culture during that time, even if not as dominant as in the 60s or 70s, it's possible that surfing was still popular. However, I need to be careful here. The 1990s might have seen a decline in surfing's mainstream popularity compared to earlier decades, but it wasn't completely out of favor. \n\nAnother angle: the term \"popular\" can be subjective. If the question is about general public interest or mainstream culture, then surfing might have been less popular than in the 60s but still had a dedicated following. However, during the mid-90s, there was also the rise of other trends, like the grunge movement, which might have overshadowed surfing. But pogs themselves were a fad, so the question is whether surfing was popular at the same time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no because by the mid-90s, surfing had become more of a niche activity, whereas pogs were a mass-market toy. However, that's not necessarily true. Surfing was still a significant part of the culture, especially in certain regions like California, Hawaii, and Australia. \n\nI should check if there's any historical data or cultural context that directly links the popularity of surfing during the pogs era. I know that the 1990s saw the rise of the internet and other media, but surfing was still covered in magazines, TV shows, and movies. For example, the movie \"Blue Crush\" came out in 2002, which is a bit later, but there were other surf-related media in the 90s. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's likely that surfing was still popular in the mid-90s when pogs were around. Therefore, the answer would be yes. However, I need to make sure there's no conflicting information. If the 90s saw a decline in surfing's mainstream popularity, then the answer would be no. But based on what I know, surfing remained a cultural phenomenon, even if not as dominant as before. \n\nAnother thought: the term \"popular\" might refer to mainstream popularity.

Well, surfing has been around for a long time, but its mainstream popularity might have fluctuated. In the 90s, there were some big surfers like Kelly Slater who were really famous.

The pogs were a specific toy fad, while surfing is a sport and a culture. \n\nBut the question isn't about which was more popular, just whether surfing was popular when pogs came out. So even if surfing wasn't as mainstream as pogs, if it was still a known and active sport, then the answer would be yes. Alternatively, maybe during the pogs era, surfing wasn't as prominent. However, I think that in the 90s, surfing was definitely a part of pop culture, even if not as much as the pogs. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is about whether surfing was a popular activity during the time pogs were popular. If pogs were around 1995-1996, then during that time, surfing was still a sport with a dedicated following. So even if it wasn't the most popular thing, it was still popular enough to be considered.

But was surfing a mainstream cultural phenomenon during the same time pogs were a big deal?\n\nSurfing has always had a strong presence in certain regions like Hawaii and California, but it's not as widely mainstream as pogs were. Pogs were a mass-market toy that became a huge fad, especially among kids. Surfing, while popular in certain circles, wasn't as universally popular as pogs. \n\nSo the question is whether surfing was popular when pogs came out. Since pogs were a specific fad in the mid-90s, and surfing was already a well-established activity with ongoing popularity, the answer might be yes. But I need to be careful. Maybe during the exact time pogs were at their peak, surfing wasn't as mainstream. However, surfing's popularity wasn't dependent on pogs. It's possible that surfing was still popular, but not necessarily as a fad like pogs. \n\nWait, the question is about whether surfing was popular when pogs came out. So if pogs came out in the mid-90s, and surfing was already a popular sport with professional events and cultural presence, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the question is implying whether surfing was as popular as pogs, which was a fad. But the question isn't asking about relative popularity, just if surfing was popular. So yes, surfing was popular during that time, even if not as much as pogs. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" I need to determine if the answer is yes or no. \n\nFirst, I should figure out when pogs came out. Pogs are those plastic discs that were a fad in the mid-90s, right? I think they became really popular around 1995. So the time frame here is the mid-90s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity can vary. In the 90s, there were some big names in surfing, like Kelly Slater. He started gaining fame in the late 80s and continued into the 90s. So during the time pogs were popular (mid-90s), surfing was definitely still a thing. \n\nBut wait, was surfing as popular as it was in the 60s or 70s? Maybe not. The 60s and 70s had more cultural impact with surf culture, but in the 90s, it was still a mainstream activity. The 90s also saw the rise of professional surfing competitions, which might have kept it in the public eye. \n\nAnother angle: were there any major events or trends in surfing during the mid-90s? The 1990s had the World Surf League, which organized competitions. So even if it wasn't as mainstream as before, it was still popular among enthusiasts. \n\nPogs themselves were a toy craze, so their popularity was more about the toy rather than the sport. But the question is about whether surfing was popular during that time. So even if it wasn't the most popular activity, the answer would depend on whether it was considered popular enough. \n\nI think the answer is yes. Surfing was still popular in the mid-90s when pogs came out. There's no indication that surfing declined significantly during that time. So the answer should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, I need to figure out if surfing was popular around the time pogs became a thing.\n\nFirst, I should recall what pogs are. Pogs are those shiny discs that were a big fad in the mid-90s, right? They were like collectible cards, and kids would play with them. I think they became really popular around 1995 to 1996. So the timeframe here is late 90s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity. Surfing has been around for a long time, but its popularity has fluctuated. In the late 90s, surfing was definitely a mainstream activity, especially with the rise of professional surfing competitions and the influence of surf culture in media. However, I need to check if it was as popular as it was during the 60s and 70s, or if it was still a significant part of pop culture.\n\nWait, the question isn't asking if surfing was the most popular thing, but whether it was popular when pogs came out. So even if it wasn't the top trend, as long as it had a significant following, the answer would be yes. But maybe the question is implying if surfing was as popular as pogs. But the question isn't comparing the two; it's just asking about surfing's popularity during the time pogs were around.\n\nSo, considering that the 90s saw surfing being part of the mainstream, with events like the World Surf League and surf brands like Quiksilver and Volcom gaining traction, surfing was definitely a popular activity. Pogs were a fad, but surfing was a more established culture. Therefore, the answer is likely yes. But I need to make sure there's no confusion between the time periods. Pogs came out in the mid-90s, and surfing was already a popular sport. So the answer should be yes, surfing was popular when pogs came out.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, first, I need to figure out when pogs became popular and then check the popularity of surfing during that time.\n\nI remember that pogs, also known as \"pocket change\" or \"pog chips,\" were a fad in the mid-90s. They were those shiny discs that kids collected, and they became really popular around 1995-1996. So the timeframe here is the mid-90s.\n\nNow, surfing's popularity has ebbed and flowed over the years. In the 90s, surfing was definitely a big part of beach culture, especially in places like Hawaii. There were famous surfers like Kelly Slater, who was dominant in the 90s. So surfing was definitely popular during the mid-90s when pogs were a thing.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check if there was a specific peak in surfing's popularity around the same time as pogs. Let me think. The 90s were a time when surfing was still a major cultural force, with the rise of professional surfing competitions and the spread of surfing culture through media. So it's likely that surfing was indeed popular when pogs came out. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": true}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" So, first, I need to figure out the time periods for both surfing's popularity and when pogs were around.\n\nPogs, also known as \"Pog Chips,\" were a fad in the late 1990s. They became really popular around 1997-1998. Now, surfing's popularity has had several peaks. The 1960s and 1970s were big for surfing, with figures like Duke Kahanamoku and the rise of surf culture. However, after the 1970s, surfing's mainstream popularity declined a bit, though it remained a niche activity. \n\nBut wait, there was a resurgence in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the popularity of professional surfers like Kelly Slater. However, the question is about when pogs came out, which was around 1997-1998. So during that time, was surfing popular? The late 90s saw some renewed interest, but was it as popular as the 60s or 70s? It's possible that surfing wasn't at its peak during the pogs era. \n\nAdditionally, pogs were a novelty item, so their popularity was more about the toy rather than the sport. So even if surfing was somewhat popular, the question is whether it was popular at the same time as pogs. Since pogs were a fad that came out in the late 90s, and surfing had a resurgence then, maybe there was some overlap. But the answer depends on whether the question considers the general popularity of surfing during that specific time. \n\nI think the answer is no. Surfing wasn't as popular during the late 90s as it was in the 60s and 70s. The pogs era was a different kind of pop culture phenomenon, not directly tied to surfing's peak. So the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}",
      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Was Surfing popular when pogs came out?\" I need to answer yes or no. First, I should figure out when pogs came out.

In the 60s and 70s, surfing was really big with the Beach Boys and the counterculture movement. But by the 90s, maybe it wasn't as mainstream as before. However, there were still surf culture events and some celebrities involved. But the question is about when pogs came out, which was in the 90s. So, was surfing popular during that time? I'm not sure. Maybe surfing wasn't as mainstream as it was in the 60s or 70s, but it was still a part of youth culture. Alternatively, maybe the popularity of surfing dipped during the 90s, but I'm not certain. I might need to check some dates. Wait, pogs became popular in the mid-90s, like around 1995. Surfing's peak was earlier. However, there's also the fact that surfing has had revivals. For example, in the 80s, there was a resurgence with the rise of professional surfing and events like the World Championships. But by the 90s, maybe it wasn't as popular as in the 70s. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe surfing remained popular enough that it wasn't a stretch to say it was popular when pogs came out. But the question is whether it was popular. If the answer is that surfing was still a known activity, even if not as mainstream as before, then maybe the answer is yes. However, if the question is about mainstream popularity, then maybe not. I think the answer is no. Because by the time pogs came out in the 90s, surfing wasn't as popular as it had been in the 60s and 70s. So the answer would be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"decision\": false}"
